"<p>After reviewing the results its concluded that all three tests were relatively accurate towards my personality and work style. While the tests were true in some parts, it was inaccurate in other areas. The results of the Myers Brig test shows that I am an Advocate (INFJ-T). According to Myers-Briggs an advocate’s strengths are creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and altruistic. Through self-evaluation an advocate’s strengths do match my strengths. An advocate’s weaknesses are sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary, and prone to burnout. One aspect of the results I disagree with in the Myer-Briggs test is that advocates are perfectionistic. While I do believe its important to put in one hundred percent effort into my work, I do realize that we do not live in a perfect world and not everything can be perfect.</p>"+

"<h4>Discussion of the Ideal Jobs Table </h4>" +
"<p>Across the Kangaroos 5 members there are 3 distinct disciplines or career paths mentioned. Tatsuya looking to enter industry as a software developer, Tarish is after a position in cyber security and both Nicole and Ben’s ideal roles are similar within the field of data science (Nicole’s leaning towards data analytics, Ben’s with a required domain knowledge in biology. </p>"+
"<p>All our ideal roles require between 2-5 years of experience which makes them achievable in the recent future when considered as an accurate reflection of each team member’s life and career experience in and around the IT field. This leaves room for some years gaining experience in entry level jobs for a few years in order to explore the field in a practical sense and really gain an understanding of what it is like to work in the fields that we have chosen before settling into a more long-term position. </p>"+
"<p>Surprisingly, only Ben and Tatsuya’s ideal jobs specifically require a tertiary degree, with Nicole’s jobs favouring proficiency in industry standard skills with a practical body of work to show for it, and Tarish’s preferring industry standard security certifications (which admittedly do require some tertiary level education, just not a full bachelor's degree) (Meah 2022). </p>"+
"<p>With regards to the skills required for each job Ben and Nicole’s related roles require similar language, tool and soft skills. Tatsuya’s requires similar soft skills but a more tailored tool and language set as is befitting of a software dev role. Tarish’s role in security is one that prioritises proficiency in soft skills (teamwork, leadership, experience) with assumed technical tool, problem solving skills, and language proficiency.   </p>"+
"<p>All four members of our group are in the earlier stages of our IT careers and understandably lack the necessary technical skills and experience required for our ideal jobs. That said, every team member has a plan as to how we will obtain these skills and work towards their goals as is discussed below in the Career Plans table. </p>"+
"<p>A note from Ben on the change in ideal job:</p>"+
"<p>Furthering my progress through the modules and learning more about what certain aspects of the IT industry involve, my ideal job has changed slightly. My current preference is leaning more towards the bioinformatics, data science, and analytics side. This would still be with a company such as CSL, but in a position where my domain knowledge in biology can be better utilised and expanded upon. </p>"+
"<p>A data scientist role has similar requirements to that of a data engineer but leaning more heavily on scientific and programming skills than backend systems management. The Garvan Institute of Medical Research based out of Sydney recently posted a job regarding a bioinformatician role in their Centre for Population Genomics division that sounds incredible (if only I had the experience). This role has similar qualification requirements to the CSL data engineer position along with fluency in one or more coding languages (Python preferred), Linux CLI, experience with cloud working environments, and the ability to work alongside various teams (Garvan Institute of Medical Research via SEEK 2023). The Bioinformatician role differs in that it requires experience with large genetic datasets, significant experience using GitHub in a collaborative fashion where it does not require as many of the technical server-side data management and storage requirements of the data engineer position. </p>"+

"<p>Our group members also express some differences concerning their career plans. Despite the fact that all team member’s job titles fall under the STEM category, each has listed a distinct job title. This has led to members seeking to acquire a diverse range of skills. For instance, Tarish refers to standard certifications like CISSP, CISA, and CISM, while Ben and Nicole refer to particular programming languages like Python. The diverse interests amongst team members has been beneficial for this assignment, as members have been able to contribute in areas where they have a unique interest. </p>"+

"<h3>•How well do we think the GitHub log of activity reflects our group’s work on this assignment?</h3>" + 
"<p> Ben: As we have made predominantly content updates and stylistic changes to the website, I believe yes, the GitHub log of activity is a representation of the work that we put in (to the website that is). That said, obviously the timeline is not accurate as we preferred to keep our focus mainly on the content and developing of the ideas involved in the project as opposed to uploading website updates. This explains why the majority of the commits were made in the last week of the project. As I said in the previous assessment, I do not believe these logs are a good metric for the work put in by the team necessarily as it does not factor in any of the research time or effort that goes into formulating responses, as wel as the general formatting that is involved in the other aspects of the project. </p>" +
"<p> Nicole: I believe that the GitHub log of activity reflects decently well on how our group worked on this assignment. Primarily as a result of individuals uploading the particular assignment sections that they have personally worked on, with a few minor exceptions. </p>" +
"<p> Tarish: The group found that the GitHub log was an easy to use tool that substantially helped in the work of logging and tracking issues. I personally also valued the fact that numerous individuals were experienced in utilising GitHub, which assisted in the quick and efficient resolution of any issue that arose.  </p>" +
"<p> Tatsuya: GitHubs activity log is a usefull tool that helps keep track of our teams overall contribution. It is evident that the whole team is contributing towards our assignment by observing the activity and commits in the log. As this assignmnet is a continuation of the previous assignment not much has been changed however, it can be seen that all members of the group have uploaded there respective parts.  </p>" +

"<h1><i class='fa-solid fa-clipboard-list'></i> Project Plan</h1>" + 
"<h2>Project Description </h2>" + 
"<hr>" +

"<h2>Overview </h2>" + 
"<h4>Topic</h4>"+
"<p>The idea for the Courtesy Light came out of a desire to provide drivers a means to show appreciation or apologise to our fellow road users via a simple 'Sorry' or 'Thanks' shown on an LED display. The Courtesy Light will be an Arduino powered device connected to a simple array of LED screen display panels triggered by 2-4 small buttons easily accessible to the driver. We give drivers the option of two default presets, 'Sorry' and 'Thanks', as well as the option to provide two of their own customisable options (provided they stay within user guidelines). </p>" +
"<p>All of this will be controlled via an easy-to-use app where users can configure their Bluetooth and notification settings, find version details and an FAQ section, and users who have opted for the additional custom buttons can add their messages here. Due to the laws surrounding use of mobile phones whilst driving, none of the actual operation of the Courtesy Light can occur via the app (VicRoads 2021a). </p>" +
"<p>The design and IT componentry are relatively simple to allow for modularity and futureproofing. If some aspect of the Courtesy Light is found to be in breach of a law or standard in one state or country for example, modifications to the design can be made quickly and easily, in order to align the Courtesy Light device and/or processes with said laws or standards. </p>" +

"<h4>Motivation</h4>"+
"<p>The traditional courtesy wave gesture used by many today is a great means of preventing potential conflict but is being used significantly less as time goes on (Guthrie 2017). We wanted to provide a simple, convenient, universal design solution to this problem that most importantly, does not break the bank, which is how we landed on the Arduino Uno powered LED design shown in the following sections. </p>" +
"<p>We hit these goals through the following means; use of minimal, readily available electronic components, flexible mounting options, simple activation via the press of a button, the design is easy to expand and modify to suit a range of different vehicle types with a universal mounting solution to ensure customisable, convenient fit to any model. </p>" +
"<p>Upon assessing articles from several sources online, these three stood out as both reliable sources and realistic lists; 'The top 10 tech trends in 2023 everyone must be ready for' by Bernard Marr for Forbes (2022), 'Gartner top 10 strategic technology trends for 2023' by David Groombridge for Gartner (2022), and 'IT trends for 2023' published by CIOPages.com (2023). Across all three, The Courtesy Light project does not particularly fit, the closest topics we relate to mentioned across the three would be IoT devices and sustainable technology but honestly, these are a bit of a stretch to fit our project under. IT is moving in the direction of big data analysis, automation, AI, and expanding on the web 3 revolution (Marr 2022; Groombridge 2022; CIOPages 2023). The truth is that the Courtesy Light is an easy to setup and manage solution to a pressing problem. Autonomous vehicles do not have full adoption as of yet and until they do, any system that can be put in place to help reduce road rage incidences is a plus (Muñoz 2023). </p>" +

"<h4>Landscape</h4>"+
"<p>There are several products available online that perform similar functions to the Courtesy Light. The product in Figure 7 was found on the Kogan Australia website. It has similar functions to the Courtesy Light in that it is designed to be mounted to the inside of the rear windscreen and displays scrolling messages on demand. There are a number of similar generic designs, many of which seem to possess very similar LED panels in their construction as can be found on online marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon, Figure 8 is one such example. What the Courtesy Light has over these products is the fact that the majority of these cheap generic competition devices are powered via the car cigarette lighter whereas our design is powered by eight AA batteries via a battery holder, the triggering of these other devices is via a remote as opposed to buttons that can be easily operated without needing to divert the driver’s attention from the road. Finally, the Courtesy Light has the companion app, allowing the user to tweak the functionality of their Courtesy Light from anywhere, enabling remote firmware updates, and easy editing of the custom messages (compared using a remote). </p>" +

"<p>Figure 9 below is a slightly different example utilising a transparent LED screen panel, these have endless customisation options, are surprisingly cost effective and are very bright and impressive, able to function like a low-resolution display. What makes these unfeasible is the power requirement (280W per m2), the requirement for a computer or media player to load content to the panel, and the fact that they quite significantly obscure the view through the rear windshield of a car despite being transparent (NSELED 2022). Separately, they do not fit within the state standards guidelines for use in Australia which shall be elaborated on further in the 'Risks' section. </p>" +

"<p>The most important points of difference between our product and the competition are that the Courtesy Light is simple and poised to be easily altered to fit with differing standards and legal requirements posed by state/territory and federal governments on the use of car mounted electronics.</p>" +

"<h2>Detailed Description </h2>" + 
"<p> </p>" +

"<hr>" +


"<h3>Aims </h3>" + 
"<p> The aim of this project is to reduce the amount of road rage incidents on public roads. To accomplish this goal, we have introduced our project idea called “The Courtesy Light” which helps aim to spread positivity in hopes that drivers will show appreciation to other fellow drivers. This will be achieved through a small, simple and sleek LED that displays “Thanks” or “Sorry” when activated by a simple press of a button by the driver. To help further accomplish our goal The Courtesy Light will be paired via Bluetooth with a corresponding app to allow for customisability and user friendliness.   </p>" +
"<p> Due to the limited amount of time and resources, our main priority is to produce a functioning prototype of “The Courtesy Light”. While the app is not essential having a functional LED display will drastically help contribute to our goal of reducing road rage incidents on public roads. The main function of the light is to show gratitude or appreciation to the other driver to help convey a positive message. A simple act of saying “Thanks” or “Sorry” can brighten up anyone’s day which will lead to a more positive mindset on public roads.  </p>" +
"<p> While the physical display of “The Courtesy Light” is the fundamental feature we also aim to make the light user-friendly and practical to enhance the user experience. Through the use of a corresponding app paired via Bluetooth we aim to add the ability to add customisable messages offering a unique way to express your gratitude, making each interaction on the road a little more special.  </p>" +

"<hr>" +


"<h3>Plans and Progress </h3>" + 
"<p> During assignment 2 multiple project ideas were presented during the group discussion. Our team took consideration of the limited time and resources available during assignments 2 to 5 which intern gave the decision to choose a project that was simple but can be easily expanded upon. This decision has led us to move forward with “The Courtesy Light” which is a small, simple, and sleek LED that displays “Thanks” or “Sorry” when called upon by the driver.  </p>" +
"<p> The aim of the project is to reduce the amount of road rage incidents and public roads with the use of an LED and an accompanying app. Understanding the scope and limitations of this project was key to deliver the projects basic features and functions within the limited time given. Knowing this we were able to split our project into two main parts being the app and the LED display.  </p>" +

"<h4>Motivation for “The Courtesy Light” </h4>"+
"<p> Our motivation for “The Courtesy Light” is centered around our experiences while driving on public roads. Whether it be our own personal experiences or friends and family, almost every vehicle owner has at least in some way been the subject of road rage. Through personal experiences we know that being a victim of road rage puts ourselves in an uncomfortable position often accompanied by stress, anxiety or anger. After doing some research we discovered that a road rage survey was conducted by insurance company Budget Direct in 2021 which found that 45% of Australians have admitted to showing signs of road rage and 75% of Australians claim to have been a victim of road rage (Budget Direct 2021). This is an alarming percentage of Australians being subjected to road rage which was a surprise as we were not aware of the amount of road rage occurring on our public roads. However, not all our experiences while driving were negative as occasionally someone will show some courtesy on the road, whether that be letting someone in, giving way or letting someone know that they left something on top of their car.  </p>" +
"<p> Regardless of the situation, we all get a sense of appreciation and think to ourselves I wish I could at least say ‘’Thanks/Sorry” to brighten up the fellow commuter’s day. Due to this discovery, it led us to create “The Courtesy Light”. Furthermore, in modern society, the use of cars has drastically expanded our capacity to travel. This is evident as according to Kemp (2022) in an article published by PD Insurance, there are currently 1.446 billion cars on the road as of 2022.  This further emphasizes our motivation for the creation of “The Courtesy Light” as there is a vast extensive market for the use of a small LED that displays “Thanks”, “Sorry”. </p>" +

"<h4>Initial Stages of the Project </h4>"+
"<p>As stated, above our team made the decision to choose a project that was simple but can be easily expanded upon which ultimately led to choosing “The Courtesy Light”. During its initial stages the LED light only consisted of the LED display with no accompanying features or apps. It was clear that our design/idea was too simple for the scope of the project which intern led us to brainstorming further features and ideas to incorporate into the project. </p>" +
"<p>The following ideas were presented: </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>Bluetooth connectivity </li>" +
"<li>Accompanying App </li>" +
"<li>Store data/statistics via cloud computing </li>" +
"<li>Text Animations </li>" +
"<li>Additional variations (E.G. Trucks, Motorbikes, cyclists, etc.)  </li>" +
"<li>Text Colour </li>" +
"<li>Customizable messages </li>" +
"<li>Language preference  </li>" +
"</ul>" + 

"<p>While all these features would be beneficial towards our goal, we were aware of the limitations of this project being time and resources. Our team ultimately decided to incorporate an accompanying app connected via Bluetooth into the design. The decision was chosen due to some team members having experience in app development which would allow our group to allocate tasks easily playing to our individual strengths and weaknesses. Our team were also debating on whether we should incorporate the storing of data for users via cloud computing, but it was ultimately decided that it was too complex for the amount of time and resources given. </p>" +

"<h4>Initial Planning of “The Courtesy Light”</h4>"+
"<p>The aim of the project is to reduce the amount of road rage incidents and public roads. We have noticed that while driving, people often forget to show appreciation to other drivers. By creating a simple and easy way to spread positivity, it is our hope that this device will be a part of the solution to the road rage we experience in our lives. Our team made it clear that the “The Courtesy Light” design should be as simple as possible to ensure that the light serves as a tool and not a distraction. For this reason, the user interface for the LED would be activated by a press of a button. The display will only allow for an option of two different messages activated via two buttons. Only having two buttons available serves as a simple way to activate the messages without the user getting overwhelmed or distracted while operating a motor vehicle. We concluded that if more buttons were added it would interfere with the driver’s awareness on the road in turn leading to a safety issue.</p>" +
"<p>As of now “The Courtesy Light” will only display “Thanks” or “Sorry”.  However, due to the incorporation of the app future expansion and customizability can be easily made through the app via updates allowing for more variability to the user. This allows for more flexibility for potential expansion of the product for future use but by default the LED will only display “Thanks” or “Sorry” which fulfills our aim of spreading acknowledgement to the other drivers. “Thanks” or “Sorry” is a simple, easy, and efficient way of showing appreciation which is known universally all around the world insuring it's not misinterpreted as a negative message. </p>" +
"<p>Conforming to simplicity we ensured that the installation process was as simple as possible. Even though there are 1.446 billion cars on the roads today (Kemp 2022), the make and model of these cars spans over 50+ years of products. Therefore, it is important that The Courtesy Light has a universal installation method, providing the ability for use in any automobile, regardless of the age or vehicle type. Due to the nature of the LED light being applicable to any car we were faced with a challenge of allowing the light to be compatible with the majority of cars today. A cheap and simple solution for this is the use of Velcro. The advantages of Velcro are it is cheap, versatile, resistant to degradation by sunlight, its adhesive strength does not change when wet, and it has the ability to hold significant amounts of weight (Sage-Advices 2020). All these advantages are very beneficial for the intended application here with the Courtesy Light. Furthermore, Velcro allows for universal installation as the user has the freedom to install the hardware in a suitable location that best fits the user’s vehicle.  </p>" +
"<p>During its current stage “The Courtesy Light” will require the user to install both the LED light and the buttons with the use of Velcro. The LED light should be installed in a suitable location behind the rear windshield that is clearly visible to other road users. An image below is an example of a suitable location for the LED light. </p>" +
"<p><b>Figure 10:</b> Diagram of suggested rear mounting.</p>" +
"<div><img src='./Figure 10.png'></div>"+
"<p>The same concept of installation applies for the buttons.  The buttons should be installed in a suitable location somewhere in the driver's seat compartment. The buttons will be mounted with the use of Velcro for easy and simple setup with the intention of user friendliness. The use of Velcro will allow the user to personalise where the buttons will be set to best suit their vehicle, personal preferences, and body type. This will allow the driver to install the buttons in a convenient location with ease of access that will not impede any other driving related tasks.  However, another challenge we faced was the risks associated with the mounting of an electronic device within a motor vehicle with laws in place to govern their use. The risks and laws associated with the “The Courtesy Light” will be further outlined and discussed in more detail in the risks section of the report. In short, Figure 1 below outlines the areas in green that will allow for lawful placement of the buttons according to Victorian Vehicle Standards Information form 27 titled ‘Fitment of equipment and accessories within the driver’s field of view’ (VicRoads 2021b).</p>" +
"<p><b>Figure 11:</b> Typical airbag deployment zone and suggested device mounting locations (VicRoads 2021b).</p>" +
"<div><img src='./Figure 11.png'></div>"+
"<p>Colour and design play an important role in creating a product that is attractive, functional, and distinguishable. A well-designed product can make it easier to use and understand, creating a wider appeal and attracting more potential customers. In a study published in the journal Sustainability, researchers were investigating the relationship between perceived ease of use of a product and customer’s continued usage of said product. They found that when a product was easy for the customer to use, they were significantly more likely to continue using it and generally had a more positive opinion of the product’s usefulness in their everyday lives (Li et al. 2019). A study by Jaehee Cho published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics looking into the continued usage of health apps came to similar conclusions (Cho 2016). It can be safely said that the more seamless the integration of an app or product with a person’s routine or habits, the more likely they are to continue to use it and recommend it to others.</p>" +
"<p>When creating a device for automotive vehicle safety is also a big consideration in the design process. This is because it can have a direct impact on the safety of the vehicle's occupants and other road users. “The Courtesy Light” will be designed with human factors in mind, to minimise driver distraction and ensure the safety of the occupants of the car and other road users. Compliance is also an important consideration for the design of The Courtesy Light. It will comply with any relevant regulations and standards for automotive devices, including safety, and cybersecurity standards that are again, further discussed below in the ‘Risks’ section. As with the release of any electronic device for use in Australia, the courtesy light must be found to fit in accordance with Part 6 - ”Type approvals for road vehicle components used or supplied for use in the manufacture of road vehicles” as is described in the Federal Road Vehicle Standard Rules 2019 (Australian Government Federal Register of Legislation 2022). Note - this only applies in the case of manufacturers utilising the design in their cars, not with our own standalone product. We plan to hire an electronics engineer to assist with these regulatory requirements and liaising with auto manufacturers.</p>" +
"<p>The colour of the LED will be green. The primary reason for this is that according to an article on ColorPsychology.org, green has long been associated with feelings of calm, tranquillity, balance and optimism (Color Psychology 2016). In addition, green was chosen as it will not interfere with the existing lights on the vehicle. If the display were to be orange or red, it may be mistaken for a turn signal or brake lights which would in turn lead to a safety hazard to other drivers.  When the display is activated, the display will be a static light. If the display were to have flashing lights or animations, it could present more of a distraction rather than a message. For this reason, once the button is pressed the message will only display for a short period of time (between 2 and 10 seconds, duration preferences would be selectable in the app), allowing the other driver to recognise the message without impeding their focus.  </p>" +

"<h4>“The Courtesy Light” Prototype Planning</h4>"+
"<p>The aim of the Courtesy Light product was to keep the design as simple as possible, for this will allow for easy and cheap manufacturing. The image shown below is a basic circuit diagram of the Courtesy Light.</p>" +
"<p><b>Figure 12: </b>Basic circuit diagram of The Courtesy Light.</p>" +
"<div><img src='./Figure 12.png'></div>"+
"<p>The circuit above demonstrates how the Courtesy light will operate and how the individual components and hardware are connected. A list of the hardware needed for “The Courtesy Light “:</p>" +

"<ul>" + 
"<li>Arduino Uno – R3 </li>" +
"<li>Generic breadboard </li>" +
"<li>12V battery holder 8 x AA </li>" +
"<li>LED matrix </li>" +
"<li>Resistors </li>" +
"<li>2 x push button </li>" +
"<li>Capacitor (Capacitor Ceramic 100nF) </li>" +
"<li>Voltage regulator 5V </li>" +
"<li>Bluetooth serial module (HC-05 Bluetooth) </li>" +
"<li>Jumper wires </li>" +
"</ul>" + 

"<p>All the components listed can also be seen in the labelled circuit diagram above. With all these components a basic version of the Courtesy light can be created. The versatility of the Arduino Uno is that the software/code written to run the device can be written and edited rather simply using a variety of languages and plugins/overlays to the Arduino IDE.</p>" +
"<p>The Courtesy Light app will use Bluetooth API (Application Programming Interface) through iOS and Android. This API will allow the app to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices, connect to them, and send and receive data. This will connect through the Bluetooth serial module as shown on the above diagram. From this, the user can use the Bluetooth API to send commands to the device (Park n.d.). </p>" +

"<h4>Virtual Prototype</h4>"+
"<p>To demonstrate how “The Courtesy Light” will operate a virtual prototype representation of the product was created to outline the basic functions and features. As previously stated, our team were faced with a challenge of limited time and resources which limited our possibilities of creating a physical prototype. This lead our team to create a virtual prototype which has its own advantages and disadvantages. By creating a virtual protype it allowed our team to run test with the flexibility to easily change code if needed however, one major drawback is the virtual simulation was limited to the default library available. The virtual circuit simulation used was <a href='https://wokwi.com/'>WOKWI</a> which allowed our group to create a basic circuit of the LED matrix to demonstrate the basic function of “The Courtesy Light”. Figure A below shows the LED matrix connected to an Arduino R3 connected to an additional two buttons. </p>" +
"<p><b>Figure A:</b>Virtual Prototype</p>" +
"<div><img src='./Figure A.png'></div>"+

"<p>By observing Figure A two buttons can be seen, one red and one green. These two buttons represent the buttons that will be mounted in the driver’s seat compartment. When the green button is pressed the LED matrix will display “Thanks” and the red button will display “Sorry”. Green and red were chosen to allow the driver to easily distinguish between “Thanks” and “Sorry”. Colour coding is an easy way to label the buttons with the corresponding message as it saves the driver having to read which would in turn cause another safety issue. Green is associated with something positive (“Thanks”) while red is associated with something negative (“Sorry”). By allocating the colour with the associated message the driver can easily distinguish between the two buttons.</p>" +
"<p>During the construction of the circuit an issue that we faced was that WOKWI doesn’t have RGB LED matrix available in the library. Because of this the current LED matrix in Figure A defaults to red, which would be a major issue if this were to be used on public roads as it may conflict with the motor vehicles’ existing brake lights. In reality this would be changed to green as discussed previously when creating our final product. However, for the purpose of this demonstration it will remain red due to the limited resources available on WOKWI. </p>" +
"<p>Another limitation of WOWKI was the Integratron of a Bluetooth module (HC-05) into the circuit. Due to WOWKI being a virtual simulation its limited inputs doesn’t allow for a Bluetooth module. However, the circuit diagram below (Figure B) shows how the corresponding components will be wired and connected. </p>" +
"<p><b>Figure B:</b>“The Courtesy Light” circuit diagram</p>" +
"<div><img src='./Figure B.png'></div>"+

"<h4>Virtual Prototype Testing</h4>"+
"<p>To demonstrate how “The Courtesy Light” will work two scenarios will be presented with the corresponding action. The following test will show how the LED light will function when called upon by the driver in a given scenario. Both scenarios will outline a list of events that may occur when driving on public roads and how the product should operate given the circumstance.  Each test will consist of two drivers being driver one and driver two with driver one having installed “The Courtesy Light”.</p>" +

"<p><b>Scenario one: </b></p>" +
"<ol>" +
"<li>Driver one: Exits a car park and accidental cuts driver two off.  </li>" +
"<li>Driver two: Clear signs of frustration towards driver one. </li>" +
"<li>Driver one: Acknowledgement of accidental mistake and proceeds to press red button. </li>" +
"<div><img src='./Figure C.png'></div>"+
"<li>Driver two: Observes message recognizes driver one’s mistake proceeds to sigh in relief.  </li>" +
"<li>Driver one: Relieved that driver two isn’t angry. </li>" +
"</ol>" +

"<p><b>Display Duration Testing</b></p>" +
"<p>Further testing was also conducted for the duration of the LED message. As mentioned above when the button is pressed by the driver the message will only display for a short period of time (between 2 and 10 seconds, duration preferences would be selectable in the app), allowing the other driver to recognise the message without impeding their focus. Using WOKWI multiple different durations were tested to identify a suitable default display duration. The following message durations were tested: </p>" +
"<ul>" +
"<li>2 seconds  </li>" +
"<li>5 seconds  </li>" +
"<li>10 seconds  </li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<p>While the user will have the customisability to change the duration via the app it was concluded that 5 seconds is an optimal duration for the message to display. Through testing it was found that 5 seconds is a suitable middle ground between 2 seconds and 10 seconds.</p>" +



"<h4>App Development Story</h4>"+
"<p>Design for the app began during assignment 2. This included building a basic understanding of platforms, what would be included and what would be required to create an app to meet the requirements. It was decided that the app would be a native app for iOS and Android. This is because native apps can be distributed through the respective app stores, having met the compliance guidelines and regulations. For the iOS app, Swift will be the programming language and XCode will be the IDE. For the Android app, Java will be the programming language and Android Studio will be the IDE. The design of the app is focused on being user-centred. To achieve this, Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics will act as a guideline for the user interface. Nielsen's usability heuristics focus on simplicity and usability, which are key factors in designing a basic app (Nielsen 1994). The purpose of the app is to connect to the Courtesy Light device and allow the user to make two individualised messages that will be displayed on the device.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Research and Inspiration</b></p>" + 
"<p> When creating an app, it can be helpful to look to other successful apps for inspiration. From their user interface to their overall design elements, these apps can provide valuable insight into what makes an app user-friendly and engaging (Babich et al., 2021). By taking inspiration from the design elements and functionality from established apps, an app can be designed to be familiar to users and easier to understand, while still offering a unique value (Helios Design, 2022). The design of the Courtesy Light app was influenced by apps with user-friendly design interfaces and Bluetooth functionality. The Smart Life app, the Wo Mic app, and the Bose Connect app are a few examples of apps that have inspired the design of the Courtesy Light app.   </p>" +
"<p> Smart Life is a smartphone app that allows users to control their smart home devices (Volcano Technology Limited, 2023). The app connects to smart home devices via Bluetooth, making it simple for users to control their devices from anywhere. Smart Life's user interface aims to be simple and easy to understand, making it easy for users to control their devices using on-screen prompts with just a few steps. Wo Mic is a smartphone app that allows users to turn their smartphone into a wireless microphone for their computer (Wolicheng Tech, 2023). The app uses Bluetooth or Wi-Fi technology to connect the smartphone to the computer, allowing users to make use of the phone's microphone as a microphone for their laptop or desktop. The app has a minimalist design, with only the absolute necessary buttons and controls available to the user. Bose Connect is a smartphone app that allows users to control their Bose headphones and speakers (Bose Corporation, 2023). The app uses Bluetooth technology to connect the smartphone to the Bose devices. This connection allows users to control their audio and adjust settings from their smartphone. The user interface of Bose Connect is simple and has a specific focus on making it easy for users to control their audio devices through Bluetooth.   </p>" +
"<p> The design elements that have proven to be effective in these applications served as inspiration for the Courtesy Light app. This includes features such as Wo Mic’s minimalist design and Bose Connect’s fast and efficient Bluetooth connectivity. The Courtesy Light app's innovation stems primarily from its seamless integration with the Courtesy Light device. Utilising tried-and-true components, and adapting them to a new product we believe will be beneficial to a new audience. This, in turn, results in a one-of-a-kind benefit for the audience of the Courtesy Light.   </p>" +
"<p> Following the research and inspiration phase, I outlined who would be the user groups for the app to get a better understanding of what their requirements would be.  </p>" +

"<p><b>User Groups</b></p>" + 
"<p> Defining user groups is beneficial for app development because it helps developers to understand potential user’s needs and preferences. By identifying different user groups, developers can create user-centred designs that are tailored to specific user motivations, technological level and requirements. The three user groups I have identified for the Courtesy Light app are; New Users, Casual Users and Regular Users. </p>" +

"</table>"+

"<p> Following the defining of user groups, I had a better understanding of who I was making the app for. From this, I was able to begin the process of designing the app.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Design Side  </b></p>" + 
"<p>The design side of app development includes creating the look and feel of an application, as well as ensuring its usability and functionality. For the Courtesy Light app this has involved the creation of keypath scenarios and wireframes and the implementation of usability heuristics. </p>" +


"<h4>App Keypath Scenarios  </h4>" +
"<p>For the beginning of the design process, I created several keypath scenarios. Keypath scenarios are a design tool where you use a scenario to build a navigable path in the design (Lowdermilk, 2013). They are useful to app design because they help ensure that an app is designed with the user in mind. To create the keypath scenario, I started by identifying the primary tasks that users will perform in the app. Next, I mapped out the steps that a user would take to complete each task. In the following scenarios I have named the user who is performing the specified tasks “Ali”. In my mind, Ali could be from any of the user groups outlined above. This means that the technological level for these paths must be accessible for users who are considered “beginners”. The scenarios were created to work for someone who is not super familiar with smartphone apps or Bluetooth technology.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Scenario 1:</b> Connecting to the device for the first time </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>Ali opens the app and taps on the 'Settings' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali chooses the “Bluetooth” option from the menu.  </li>" +
"<li>The app searches for available Bluetooth devices and displays a list of them.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali selects the device he wants to connect to from the list.  </li>" +
"<li>The app sends a request to the device to establish a connection.  </li>" +
"<li>The device accepts the connection request, and the app displays a message indicating a successful connection.  </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<p><b>Scenario 2:</b> Connecting to the device that has been previously paired and writing a new custom message for the Courtesy Light </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>Ali opens the app and taps on the 'Settings' button.  </li>" +
"<li>The app automatically connects to the device that has been previously paired as it is saved in the app's memory.  </li>" +
"<li>The app displays a message indicating a successful connection.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali returns to the app’s home screen through the navigation bar.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali taps the 'Customise' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali taps on the 'Change Message' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali types a message into the app and presses save.  </li>" +
"<li>The app sends a request to the device to change the message it's displaying.  </li>" +
"<li>The device receives the request, updates the message, and sends a confirmation to the app.  </li>" +
"<li>The app displays a message indicating a successful message change.  </li>" +
"</ol>"+

"<p> Once I created the keypath scenarios, I used them as a guide for the design and development of the app. They were beneficial in informing decisions about which features to include, how to present information, and how to make navigation intuitive.   </p>" +

"<p><b>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</b></p>" + 
"<p> Following the creation of keypath scenarios, I created a series of low-fidelity wireframes to ensure that I could fit the scenarios into the app's design. Low-fidelity wireframes are less detailed than the final design and don't focus on visual elements (Laubheimer, 2016). This allows for focusing on the layout, navigation, and functionality of the app. This also means that you are able to easily make changes before it's too late in the process. Overall, low-fidelity wireframes are beneficial for app design because they provide a fast way to explore design concepts early in the design process. </p>" +
"<div><img src='./wireframe_image.JPG'></div>"+
"<p> Following the development of the low-fidelity wireframes, they were tested against the keypath scenarios. The keypath scenarios suggested a few minor modifications that needed to be made. Making these modifications was a simple process, thanks to the simplicity of low-fidelity wireframes. Modifications included the addition of a save and clear button in the customisation menu and access to notification settings. Once these modifications were made, I began work on the app prototype.   </p>" +


"<p><b>App Prototype </b></p>" + 
"<p> The app prototype features the navigation and functionality of the app. Once the wireframes were completed, I began adding more detail to the prototypes using Figma's design tools. This included adding colours, images, and other visual elements to make the app look more polished.   </p>" +
"<p> Once the design was complete, I used Figma's prototyping tools to create a prototype that is able to simulate the app's user flow. This is an important step in the development process because it allows for testing and refining the app's design before the final app is built. This step also involved adding interactions and animations, which help to make the app feel more engaging and dynamic.  </p>" +
"<p> This is the link to the full Figma prototype: <a href='https://www.figma.com/file/FJrR4kTfKRryLjKs51xvq0/Intro-App-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1&t=1BxME1avgTbCQ0Vr-1'>Figma Prototype</a>  </p>" +

"<p> Here is a link to a video demonstrating the navigation of the app: <a href='https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/Kangaroos/ERssRRcrq7tHjrTXx_MrV0MB4WVmTmq_WEugvO9n6SNI8w?e=53zuiW '> App Video </a></p>" +

"<div><img src='./prototype_image.JPG'></div>"+



"<h5>Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics </h5>" +
"<p>For assignment 2, it was mentioned that the app’s user interface design would follow Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics. Below is an outline of how each of these heuristics is important in app design and how they each were integrated into the prototype’s UI design. </p>" +

"<p><b>1. Visibility of System Status  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_1.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Visibility of system status is important in app design because when users perform an action within an app, they expect to receive immediate feedback about the status of their request. If the system status is not visible, users may become confused, frustrated or assume that their action was not processed. </p>" +

"<p><b>2. Match Between System and the Real World  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_2.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Matching the system and the real world is important in app design because it helps create a smooth user experience. Users are better able to comprehend and navigate an app when its behaviour and interface reflect how people think and interact with the world.  </p>" +

"<p><b>3. User Control and Freedom  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_3.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>User control and freedom are important in app design as they give users the power to determine how they interact with the app. Accessibility can also be improved by allowing users to adjust the app to better meet their individual needs through user control and freedom. </p>" +

"<p><b>4. Consistency and Standards  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_4.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Consistency and standards are important in app design because they provide users with a clear and predictable experience. When an app follows established design patterns, users can understand how the app works and can easily navigate through it.  </p>" +

"<p><b>5. Error Prevention  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_5.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Error prevention is important in app design because it helps to minimise the risk of users making mistakes while using the app. This was accomplished by providing confirmations prior to carrying out potentially unintended actions, and by using the help and information page.  </p>" +

"<p><b>6. Recognition Rather than Recall  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_6.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>By prioritising recognition in app design, designers can create apps that are easy to navigate. This will reduce the cognitive load on the users. When users can recognise elements within an app, such as icons, buttons, and navigation, they are able to quickly and efficiently complete tasks without having to rely on their memory of where specific information is located. Recall, however, requires users to remember specific information, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.  </p>" +

"<p><b>7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_7.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Flexibility and efficiency of use are important in app design because they allow users to easily accomplish their goals. The app has been designed to be efficient and save users time and effort by using an intuitive interface. Users will be more likely to continue using an app if they can complete tasks quickly and easily. </p>" +

"<p><b>8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_8.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Aesthetic and minimalist design is important in app design because it can improve the user experience by making the app visually appealing and easy to navigate. Aesthetic design creates a positive first impression. Minimalist design, on the other hand, focuses on simplicity. This means reducing clutter and making it easier for users to focus on the most important elements of the app. The app has been designed to meet these heuristics through the visual design.   </p>" +

"<p><b>9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_9.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Helping users to recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors is important in app design because by providing clear error messages, users can quickly identify a problem and take steps to resolve them. This will reduce frustration for the user, making them enjoy using the app. When users can quickly identify the source of an error, they can take appropriate action to resolve the issue. In addition, providing users with self-help options, such as a FAQ, can help to solve issues without having to seek assistance from others. The Courtesy Light app provides a full FAQ and information on the device specifications.   </p>" +

"<p><b>10. Help and Documentation  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_10.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Help and documentation are important in app design because they provide users with the information and support they need to effectively use the app. Clear and concise documentation can help users understand  how to complete specific tasks. Having access to a help section will also reduce the likelihood of errors.   </p>" +


"<p><b>Technical side </b></p>" + 
"<p>The technical side of app development includes choosing a development platform, programming language, and implementing features. For the Courtesy Light app this has included the implementation of a database, Bluetooth, security, and notification functions. The details for these features are outlined below.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Database Management</b></p>" + 
"<p>The Courtesy Light app will be using SQLite as the database management system to store and manage data. SQLite is a relational database management system (RDBMS) (SQLite, 2021). In technical terms, this allows an app to store information in a SQLite database by using SQL statements to create tables and insert, update, or retrieve data from those tables.  </p>" +
"<p>Here is an overview of what that process will involve for the Courtesy Light app (SQLite Tutorial, 2022): </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>The app will establish a connection to the SQLite database. This involves opening the database file on the device and creating a connection object that can be used to interact with the database. </li>" +
"<li>The app will create a schema for the database by using SQL statements to define the structure of the tables. This will involve the columns demonstrated below. </li>" +
"<li>The app will insert data into the tables by using SQL INSERT statements. This involves specifying the values for each column in the table and then executing the statement to insert the data into the database. </li>" +
"<li>The app will also retrieve the data from the tables by using SQL SELECT statements. This involves specifying the columns and conditions for the data to be retrieved, and executing the statement to retrieve the data from the database. </li>" +
"<li>The app will be able to update data in the tables by using SQL UPDATE statements. This involves specifying the columns and conditions for the data to be retrieved and executing the statement to update the data in the database. </li>" +
"<li>The app will delete data from the tables by using SQL DELETE statements. This involves specifying the columns and conditions for the data to be retrieved and executing the statement to be deleted from the data in the database. </li>" +
"</ol>"+

"<p>Below is an example of what the code for table creation will look like: </p>" +
"<div><img src='./SQL_example.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>The table in this is called “CL_device_messages”, an identifiable name for the purpose of the table. The code has three columns for the database; device_id, message_1 and message_2. The reason behind these identifiers is outlined below: </p>" +
"<p>CL_device_messages: The title of the table. </p>" +
"<p>device_id: The identifier of the device that the message is stored on. </p>" +
"<p>message_1: The text of the first message that can be stored. </p>" +
"<p>message_2: The text of the second message that can be stored. </p>" +


"<p><b>Notification Feature </b></p>" + 
"<p>The Courtesy Light app will contain a notification service to alert the user to any changes made within the app. Notifications are an important part of the Courtesy Light app because they act as an alert to the user about changes in the status of the system and alert the user to any events that have occurred. The purpose that notifications serve is to keep the user informed about what is happening in the system in real-time, without the need for the user to actively seek out this information (Salazar, 2015). They also provide the user with a quick and convenient way to take action if need be. All of this can be related back to the first usability heuristic outlined earlier: visibility of system status. There are two types of notifications that the Courtesy Light app will send; push notifications and in-app notifications.  </p>" +
"<p>Push notifications are messages sent by apps that can appear on a smartphone device at any time. These notifications are part of both iOS or Android devices, with both systems having built-in tools to develop a push notification system. Push notifications are able to appear on the lock screen and in the notification centre, even if the app is not currently in use. The Courtesy Light app will include push notifications to alert the user to important updates to the device or messages from the Courtesy Light team. When an app sends a push notification, the following process occurs (Salesforce, 2022) (Ibrahim, 2021) (Bhardwaj, 2020): </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>The app generates a notification payload. The notification payload consists of the message text, title, and any additional data needed. </li>" +
"<li>The app uses the respective push notification services; Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS and Firebase for Android.</li>" +
"<li>The app registers with the push notification service and receives a unique device token.</li>" +
"<li>The app server sends a request to the push notification service. This will include the device token and the notification payload. </li>" +
"<li>The push notification service receives the API request and sends the notification payload to the device which is associated with the device token.  </li>" +
"<li>The device receives the notification payload and displays the notification to the user.</li>" +
"<li>The user interacts with the notification. The app then retrieves and executes the additional information included in the notification payload, if there is any. </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<div><img src='./push_flow.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>In-app notifications are messages sent by an app to the user while they are actively using the app on their iOS or Android device. The Courtesy Light app will include in-app notifications concerning changes to the Bluetooth connection and changes to the message display. These notifications will be displayed as pop-up alerts within the app interface. Unlike push notifications, in-app notifications do not appear on the lock screen or in the notification centre. When an app sends an in-app notification, the following process occurs (Salesforce, 2022) (Microsoft Learn, 2023):</p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>The app generates a notification payload. The notification payload consists of the message text, title, and any additional data needed. </li>" +
"<li>The app's code determines when to show the notification, based on when certain events occur within the app, such as the user selecting 'Bluetooth' or changing the messages in the app. </li>" +
"<li>The app sends a request to the REST API to retrieve the notification payload.</li>" +
"<li>The app then analyses the notification payload and displays the notification to the user within the app's interface.</li>" +
"<li>When the user interacts with the notification, the back-end will be updated with the new status (e.g. read and accepted or dismissed). </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<div><img src='./notif_flow.JPG'></div>"+

"<p><b>Bluetooth </b></p>" + 
"<p>Building on from assignment 2, the Courtesy Light device and app will connect to each other via Bluetooth. This will be a process done through collaboration with the SQLite Database. When the Courtesy Light device and app connect via Bluetooth, they will be able to exchange data with each other (Gomez et al., 2012). </p>" +
"<p>To use Bluetooth in the app, the app must first be granted permission from the user. The process for granting Bluetooth access for app notifications is slightly different on Android devices compared to iOS. On Android devices, the user can find the app's Bluetooth permissions in their smartphone's settings (Android Help, 2023). Here they can either allow or deny the Courtesy Light access to their Bluetooth. On iOS devices, the user will be prompted with an in-app notification asking for permission to turn on Bluetooth for the Courtesy Light (Apple Support, 2022). For the Bluetooth connection, the app will discover the Bluetooth serial module attached to the Courtesy Light device, and establish a Bluetooth connection with it. This will be done using the Bluetooth libraries; Android's Bluetooth API and iOS's Core Bluetooth framework. Once this connection is established, the app can communicate with the device over the Bluetooth connection. This will include the sending and receiving data through the SQLite database.  </p>" +
"<p>The following steps show the flow of data from the app, to the database, to the Courtesy Light device: </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>The user launches the app on their device and selects the Bluetooth device they want to connect to. </li>" +
"<li>The app establishes a Bluetooth connection with the device. </li>" +
"<li>The user can now use the app's customisation screen to change the message displayed on the device. </li>" +
"<li>When the user saves the new message, the app sends a request to the SQLite database to update the message. </li>" +
"<li>The SQLite database updates either the message_1 or message_2 column in the table and sends a confirmation back to the app. </li>" +
"<li>The app retrieves the updated message from the database and sends it to the device over the Bluetooth connection. This will, in turn, update the message displayed on the device. </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<div><img src='./Data_flow.JPG'></div>"+

"<p><b>Security</b></p>" + 
"<p>Security is an important consideration when creating the Courtesy Light app because it helps to protect user information, and prevents unauthorised access. The use of Bluetooth technology creates a need for security measures to ensure that the Courtesy Light app data and device are protected (Padgette et al., 2022). There are several ways that security will be implemented for the Courtesy Light, including the use of Bluetooth Low Energy, LE Secure Connections and regular firmware updates.  </p>" +
"<p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is good for security because it uses encryption algorithms to secure data transmission, making it difficult for outsiders to intercept and decode data (Li & Cui, 2019). Additionally, BLE uses short-range communication. This limits the range of communication available and reduces the risk of interference from any unauthorised devices. BLE also has several built-in security features that can be used to encrypt data and protect against unauthorised access, such as LE Secure Connections.</p>" +
"<p>LE Secure Connections is another security measure for establishing a secure Bluetooth connection. LE Secure Connections is a security feature that was introduced in Bluetooth version 4.2 (Ren, 2022). It works by generating a private and a public key on each device. The public keys are then used to exchange and verify information during the pairing process. Once the devices are paired, the connection is encrypted using a shared secret key. This key is generated by combining the public and private keys of both devices. This process will, in turn, protect against any potential security threats. LE Secure Connections is supported on both Android and iOS devices that are compatible with BLE 4.2. </p>" +
"<p>Updating the device's firmware is also good for security, because it works to fix vulnerabilities in the software that could otherwise be exploited (Bettayeb et al., 2019). As new security threats are discovered, firmware updates are released to address these issues, and improve the security of the device. By installing the latest firmware updates, users can make sure that their devices have the most up-to-date security features and that they are protected against known security threats. The Courtesy Light app will also require updates as the security standards change for iOS and Android devices. </p>" + 
"<p><b>Future Steps </b></p>" + 
"<p>Now that the design prototype has been tested and refined, and the technical aspects have been discussed, the Courtesy Light app can be turned into a real application. Figma's code export feature allows developers to generate the assets needed for the app (Figma Help Center, 2022). From this, these assets will be used to build the app through the Xcode and Android Studio IDEs. Before the app is released, it will need to go through thorough testing to ensure that it works as expected, and to fix any bugs or glitches. Testing for the app is explained further in the testing section of this assignment.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Publishing </b></p>" + 
"<p>The app will be published to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The publishing process for each differs slightly.</p>" +
"<p>To publish an app on the Apple App Store, you need to register as an iOS developer and create an Apple Developer account (Apple Inc., 2023). An app listing in App Store Connect, which is Apple's portal for managing your app, will then need to be created. This listing will include adding details such as the app name, description, and screenshots. The price for the Courtesy Light app will be free, with the cost of development being factored into the pricing of the Courtesy Light device. Once the app is ready, it can be submitted for review to the App Store. During the process of reviewing an app, Apple typically takes a few days to verify that it complies with Apple's App Store Guidelines and is free of bugs and other issues. Once the app has been approved, it will be available for download on the Apple App Store. </p>" +
"<p>To publish an app on the Google Play Store, you need to register as an Android developer and create a Google Play Developer account (Android, 2023). A new app listing on the Google Play Console will need to be created after the account has been set up (Google Play, 2023). This requires the information about the app, such as its title, description, and screenshots. The APK file will also need to be uploaded for review. The APK file is the package of the app's code and resources. This is also the time to set the app's pricing and distribution options. This will match the details from the Apple App Store publishing. Because the app is a native app, it will have met Google Play's policies and guidelines. Once all of these details are complete, the app is ready to be submitted for review. The review process for Android apps will typically take a few days. Once the app has been approved, it will be available for download on the Google Play Store. </p>" +

"<p><b>Maintenance and Update Compatibility  </b></p>" + 
"<p>Maintenance and update compatibility are important factors to consider when creating an app. Maintenance is important for any application because it ensures that the app remains secure, stable, efficient, and relevant for its users. User feedback is an important part of the creation of any application as it provides developers with a 2-way communication channel with their user base. It is an important tool for ensuring that The Courtesy Light app is meeting the needs of its users. This helps with making data-driven decisions about how to improve the app. User feedback will be collected within the app, through the support email on the Help and Information page. The updates for the app will be centred around what the feedback has told the development team. The type of feedback users will be able to provide from within the app will include reporting any errors that they have encountered and any recommendations they may have (Singh 2020). The user feedback feature will also follow Nielsen's heuristics guidelines and be simple and easy to use, making the option to provide feedback accessible.  The feedback that is received will also provide the developers with more detailed information on how users are interacting with the app and Courtesy Light device. </p>" +


"<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions </b></p>" + 
"<p>The app information page includes a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. The FAQ is designed to answer any questions the user may have in regard to using the app, and allows the user to resolve any issues they may have. A copy of the text from the FAQ is printed below. </p>" +

"<h3>Roles</h3>" + 
"<p>For this assignment our group decided to adopt a holistic approach. This meant that we did not assign specific roles, such as Lead Developer, Technical Designer, or User Interface Designer, to team members. Instead, we encouraged everyone to take on different tasks and responsibilities as needed, based on their strengths, interests and expertise. This approach allowed us to take advantage of the unique skills and perspectives of each team member, leading to a more collaborative and efficient project.   </p>" +
"<p>One of the benefits of taking this approach is that it fosters a sense of teamwork and encourages open communication among all team members (Tumpa et al., 2022). By not having specific roles, team members are free to share their thoughts and ideas on different sections, which will lead to a stronger project outcome. Additionally, this approach encourages team members to develop new skills and take on new challenges, which will hopefully lead team members to personal and academic growth. A holistic approach to a group project also allows for flexibility and adaptability (Freifeld, 2018). For example, if one team member is unable to complete their assigned task, the rest of the team can step in to support them. This not only ensures that the project continues to progress, but it also strengthens the team's ability to work together effectively.   </p>" +

"<hr>" +


"<h3>Scope and Limits </h3>" + 
"<p>Out teams’ overall goal is to reduce the amount of road rage incidents on public roads by showing positivity and appreciation to other fellow road users. Due to the limited amount of time and resources available we opted for “The Courtesy Light” due to its simple design with the potential to easily scale the product to suit a variety of form factors. “The Courtesy Light’s” fundamental function is to display “Thanks” or “Sorry” when called upon by the driver by a simple press of a button. Furthermore, we are also going to further improve the products user-interface by an accompanying app allowing for two additional customisable messages. With these two cores features we will be able to produce an accurate representation of our product to achieve our main goal. To demonstrate “The Courtesy Light” our design we will provide a virtual representation of the product in a simulation to outline its core features and functions providing a rough overview of the prototype. A simple protype of the app will also be presented outlining the user-interface and layout to demonstrate how the user will interact with the “The Courtesy Light”. </p>" +
"<p>However, as stated before “The Courtesy Light” has the potential to expand upon its features and form. As of now the product is only available in English and is only suitable for a car. Due to its simple nature the “The Courtesy Light” can be easily improved upon by offering additional variations to accommodate trucks/semi-trailers, motorcyclists, and cyclists. This can be achieved by simply adjusting the size of the module to safely and reliably fit in the users preferred mode transportation (i.e Car, Truck, Bike, Scooter, etc.).  The potential of a unique version of the “The Courtesy Light” can be offered to cyclists by incorporating indicators similar to car indicators to offer a more immersive and practical use for the product. The accompanying app can also be further improved by incorporating more features and customisability to the user such as colours or animations or adding additional languages. </p>" +

"<h4>App Scope</h4>" +
"<p>The app design has four main goals. These goals are considered the scope of the app.  </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>Pairing and Connecting: The app should provide a simple way for the user to connect to the Courtesy Light device and establish a Bluetooth connection. </li>" +
"<li>Message customisation: The app should allow the user to create and edit custom messages to be displayed on the Courtesy Light. </li>" +
"<li>Secure Connection: The app should ensure secure communication between the user's device and the Courtesy Light to protect user data. </li>" +
"<li>User-friendly interface: The app should have a user-friendly interface, to make it easy for users to use all of its features.  </li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<h4>App Limits</h4>"+
"<p>An app's design often determines its limitations, and one of the key decisions developers must make is whether to focus on simplicity or include a wide range of features. While having many features can be appealing to some users, it can also make the app more complex and harder to use (Selway, 2013). The Courtesy Light app design has opted for a simple and straightforward approach. There are several reasons for why this was chosen. Making an app simple can be important for attracting a wider audience, including those who may not be very tech-savvy. Many people are intimidated by complex technology and prefer apps that are straightforward and easy to use (Loranger, 2015). By focusing on simplicity in the design process, the Courtesy Light app was created to be accessible and user-friendly for a wide range of users, regardless of their technical expertise. More specifically, the Courtesy Light app is made for people who want a simple app that doesn't require a complicated setup or technical problems. The app is also designed to be more accessible for people who are unfamiliar with Bluetooth technology, with on screen prompts guiding the user through the connection process.   </p>" +


"<hr>" +


"<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>" + 
"<h4>App Tools and Technologies  </h4>" +
"<p>The developers will be using the latest stable release for the tools involved in the development of the Courtesy Light app. Using the latest stable release for programs is beneficial because the latest stable release contains the most recent improvements available (Humble & Farley, 2010). This may include new features and functionality that will make the development process easier. Using the most recent stable release is also likely to have improved compatibility with the most recent libraries, technologies, and tools. This is particularly crucial for the Courtesy Light's Bluetooth API compatibility.   </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>The latest stable release of XCode is version 14.2  </li>" +
"<li>The latest stable release of Android Studio is Android Studio Electric Eel | 2022.2.  </li>" +
"<li>The latest stable release of Swift is version 5.7.3  </li>" +
"<li>The latest stable release of Java is Java 19  </li>" +
"<li>The latest stable release of SQLite is version 3.40.1 </li>" +
"<li>Firebase Cloud Messaging </li>" +
"<li>Apple Push Notification Service </li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<p>The low-fidelity wireframes and app prototype use the web application Figma.  </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>Figma developed by Figma, Inc. Note: Figma has a free and premium version. I have used the premium version for the prototype, because I have a license from another course I am doing.   </li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<h4>Prototyping Tools and Technologies  </h4>" +
"<p>At its current stage in development The Courtesy Light’s physical hardware components required are listed below:  </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>Arduino Uno – R3 </li>" +
"<li>Generic breadboard</li>" +
"<li>12V battery holder 8 x AA</li>" +
"<li>LED matrix modules </li>" +
"<li>Resistors </li>" +
"<li>2x push buttons</li>" +
"<li>Capacitor (Capacitor Ceramic 100nF)</li>" +
"<li>Voltage regulator 5V </li>" +
"<li>Bluetooth serial module (HC-05 Bluetooth) </li>" +
"<li>Jumper wires (copper cabling) </li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<p>To assemble The Courtesy Light basic electrical circuit theory is required to connect and wire the hardware together. However, in Australia a Class 1 licence is required for any electrical installation work which falls under Regulation 18(d) of the Electrical Safety (Regulation and Licencing) Regulations 2020 (energysafe Victoria 2023). The required skills and qualifications needed to assemble/test The Courtesy Light in accordance with the Licencing and Registration Regulations are as follows: </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>Certificate 3 in instrumental and control </li>" +
"<li>Certificate 4 in instrumental and control  </li>" +
"<li>BSc – electronic and electrical engineering</li>" +
"<li>Certificate 3 in security equipment</li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<p>As for the casing for The Courtesy Light a custom case can be manufactured with the use a robust 3D printer (or multiple printers as scaling and prototyping requires) such as a Raise3D Pro2 plus. Particularly for the engineer and potentially marketing people to get involved in early on in terms of designing the product enclosures.</p>" +
"<p>3D CAD software is also required to design the prototypes for printing. There are a number of free options available with the best of them being Blender due to its expansive feature set, the fact that it is open source, and most importantly, it has an expansive community of users online (Allen 2022). There is a slight learning curve to the software and designing aspects so having one experienced person on the team initially would be a bonus (Bardwell 2023).</p>" +
"<p>To round out the electronics lab requirements are a series of relatively inexpensive tools that should form the backbone of every good electronics workshop (Santos 2016).</p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>A soldering station  </li>" +
"<li>Hot glue gun  </li>" +
"<li>Dremel rotary tool  </li>" +
"<li>Multimeter  </li>" +
"<li>Precision screwdriver set  </li>" +
"<li>Wire stripper/cutter tool  </li>" +
"<li>Third Hand tool  </li>" +
"<li>Ceramic tweezers </li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<p>The Courtesy light will also require software skills to program the required code for the LED to function. The language used for Arduino is C++ which is processed and compiled to machine language. The required code will be written using the Arduino interface known as the Arduino Integrated Development Environment or Arduino IDE for short (Circuito Team 2018). </p>"+

"<hr>" +


"<h3>Testing</h3>" +
"<p>After we develop the idea ourselves, with all of the features and design capabilities to handle the use-cases we see fit, we will conduct a survey (created via free online tool Survey Monkey) in order to gather feedback from the general public. The questions in this survey will cover people’s past experience with road rage, the likelihood of consumers taking up a product like the Courtesy Light, what types of transport they use, and what potential extra features they would like to see from a product like the Courtesy Light that could potentially be implemented into future revisions. This survey can be accessed via the following link <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3KVYVQS'> https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3KVYVQS</a>. </p>" +
"<p>Market testing or beta testing is a critical stage in bringing a product to market. It involves testing the product with a smaller group of potential customers or early adopters to gather feedback and make any necessary improvements before the releasing the product to the full market (Teel 2016). Bringing a new product to the market is costly so it is paramount that concept development & testing along with market testing is done to extract as much feedback and data for the focused market. The demographic to target for the courtesy light is car owners who want to convey appreciation and gratitude to other drivers on the road. Additionally, the product can appeal to individuals who want a simple and user-friendly way to improve road safety by drawing attention to reckless driving behaviours. The strategy that projects team has decided on here is to conduct a survey targeted towards ride sharing drivers and delivery partners, such as Uber and Lyft, that can help to gather important feedback on the idea and gauge interest in participating in the concept testing. A full working week for an average uber driver is around 37.4 hours according to Alexander et al. (2022).  </p>" +
"<p>We believe that because they spend a significant amount of time on the road and are more likely to have noticed a gap in the market for this product, this demographic will be ideal for contributing to our testing phase. The results of the survey, feedback from the concept testing phase, and any additional data and insights gathered through market research will be included in our acceptance criteria for this project. Our acceptance criteria for this project will be based on three key factors: Functionality, Performance, and Usability/Compatibility. Our goal is to ensure that the product meets the needs and expectations of our target market and performs well in real-world scenarios. The data and feedback collected through our survey and concept testing phase will be used to evaluate the product's functionality and performance, while user experience and compatibility with different car models and road conditions will also be taken into consideration. Ultimately, we aim to develop a product that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of our target market and contributes to road safety. Survey Monkey, a popular survey tool, will be used to collect data and insights from our target demographic. </p>" +
"<p>This information will help us determine the product's potential success and guide the next steps in its development and commercialisation. In addition, we will assess the product's ability to meet customer expectations and provide a positive user experience. This will be done during the concept testing phase, in which we will create 6-8 concept designs and distribute them to Uber drivers who expressed interest in participating via the survey. We will collect feedback from participants on their experience with the concepts, including usability, design, and overall satisfaction, using survey monkey once more. This data will be used to improve the design during subsequent product development and, ultimately, to bring the product to market with confidence that it will meet the needs and expectations of its target audience. The ultimate goal of this project is to bring to market a product that solves a problem and adds value to its target audience. We will consider the project successful if it meets the requirements and standards outlined in the project plan and passes all tests with few or no errors. Additionally, user feedback and acceptance of the final product will be used to determine project success. </p>" +
"<h4>App Development Testing </h4>" +
"<p>App testing is an essential part of software development and a crucial step in ensuring the quality and usability of an application. App testing is an iterative process (Unadkat, 2022), and it is important to repeat the testing process multiple times to ensure that the app is high quality and meets the needs of the users. There are several stages of app testing, including unit testing, functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user testing (Android, 2022). These types of testing all require a different approach in order to test the app’s functionality.   </p>" +
"<p>Unit testing involves testing individual components of an app to ensure they function as expected while in isolation from other components. This type of testing helps identify and fix any bugs or errors in the early stages of development (Muccini et al. 2012). This will make it easier to catch and fix problems before they have the chance to get worse. Functional testing is the process of verifying that an app meets its specified requirements and functions as intended. During functional testing, the app is tested in different scenarios, such as different input combinations, different screen sizes, and different operating systems. This is done to make sure it works as expected under different conditions. Performance testing is the process of evaluating an app’s performance and behaviour under different real-world conditions. This type of testing is designed to identify performance bottlenecks and other issues that may impact the user experience. This includes testing for things such as slow load times, or poor app responsiveness. Security testing is the process of evaluating the app's security features. This is done to identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited. User testing is the final step in the testing process, where the app is tested by users to ensure that it meets their requirements and expectations. This is done as part of a beta test run or market research testing. We have outlined our plans to conduct this type of testing elsewhere in this section.  </p>" +
"<p>Testing for an app can be done manually or through an automated system/program (Pai, 2022). Manual testing involves a human tester performing a set of test cases/scenarios on the app to test its functionality and identify any bugs or issues with their experience. Automated testing involves the use of tools and scripts to automate the testing process. Both manual and automatic testing have advantages. The choice between the two will often depend on the nature of the application, as well as the resources and budget available for the development team (Stanic, 2023). The testing for the Courtesy Light app will only require manual testing, due to the size and nature of the app.  </p>" +
"<p>Concerning what testing has so far taken place for the Courtesy Light app, all testing has been within the unit testing and functional testing stages. This is because the prototype created for this assignment is UI design based, rather than programming based. Further development on the app would require completing other stages of testing to take place to ensure a fully functional and efficient app. Testing has included creation of keypath scenarios and low-fidelity wireframes. The keypath scenarios that were created were concerned with achieving the user’s goals for using the app. These were created to ensure that the user goals can be accomplished through the app's design and navigation. The Low-Fidelity wireframes were beneficial to the testing process because they are an easy way to test functionality. By creating a simple and rough outline of the app's structure, it was easy to identify and address potential issues with the layout, navigation, and overall user experience. This in turn allowed for faster prototyping, resulting in a smoother design process. When tested, the keypath scenarios worked effectively with the wireframes. This suggests that the design has so far proven functional.    </p>" +

"<hr>" +

"<h3>Timeframe</h3>" + 

"<p>Starting in week 1, we created a basic idea for how long the project may take, based on research from similarly sized tech projects. This resulted in the following estimate: </p>" +

"<ul>"+
"<li>Concept and feasibility phase: 2-4 weeks </li>"+
"<li>Design and prototyping phase: 4-8 weeks </li>"+
"<li>Testing and verification phase: 4-8 weeks </li>"+
"<li>Manufacturing and quality assurance phase: 8-12 weeks </li>"+
"</ul>"+

"<p>This gives a total estimated timeline of 18-32 weeks or 4-8 months. Compared to other similar tech projects, this timeline is relatively short, as it involves only basic features and simple hardware. For example, the development timeline for a more complex device could take 12-18 months or longer, due to the larger number of features and components involved (Crucible Design, 2019) (Pacific Research, 2020) (Teel, 2022).  </p>" +
"<p>Understanding the timeframe for this project requires consideration to the fact that our team is that of university students, while a comparative team would be a team of professionals. This creates several gaps that affect the timeframe for the product to be produced. One of the main differences is the level of experience and knowledge that each group brings to the table. Professional teams typically consist of individuals who have been in the industry for a number of years. This means that they have a lot of experience and knowledge to work from, while our team for this project has limited knowledge and experience to work from. Our team members also have jobs, classes, and other commitments, which limits how much time and effort they can devote to the project. When compared to a project completed by a professional team, who are able to devote their full attention to the task at hand, this can result in a product that takes a significantly longer timeframe to produce. Professional teams will also typically have access to a wider variety of resources which can have a significant impact on the timeframe. This includes resources such as expertise, software, and equipment. While our team is limited by our budget and resources. Professional teams are also often working with real clients or stakeholders and are under pressure to deliver a high-quality product within a specified timeframe and budget. Our project, on the other hand, has less pressure. </p>" +

"<h3>Risks</h3>" + 
"<p>There are several risks associated with the mounting of an electronic device within a motor vehicle with laws in place to govern their use. Awareness of these laws and their varying applications around the Australia (and the rest of the world) will help prevent any potential legal roadblocks to widespread application of the Courtesy Light. This will have the added benefit of reducing the risk of any legal action that may come as a result of designing and marketing a product with the potential to incriminate the user when used as directed.</p>" +
"<p>Besides the obvious physical risks of having multiple components of the device mounted to the inside of the car, we overcame this in a relatively simple manner via the use of Velcro. We chose Velcro for its good resistance to UV and moisture, ability to maintain its grip/stick power over time, and the fact that it is both lightweight and extremely cheap to implement (Sage-Advices 2020). As alluded to in the opening paragraph of this section, the largest subset of risks that we face in developing the Courtesy Light is that of the legalities surrounding the mounting and operation of an electronic device whilst driving. In the VicRoads webpage discussing mobile phones, technology, and driving, they state that most of the legal issues behind using electronics whilst driving surround phones due to the highly distracting nature of these devices. Thankfully in our case with the Courtesy Light, it can be run as a standalone device, with the companion app not required for operation, thus leading to its classification as a device akin to a GPS or ‘authorised driver’s aid’ (VicRoads 2021a). </p>" +
"<p>As discussed in the plans and progress section, this brings to bear the issue of mounting the device. Victorian Vehicle Standards Information form 27 titled ‘Fitment of equipment and accessories within the driver’s field of view’, contains a figure that details the areas available to mount a driver’s aid device which can be seen below in Figure 1. The original proposed idea of having small buttons mounted to the inner portions of the steering wheel is illegal as it turns out, this is due to this whole area being classified as an Airbag-deployment zone (VicRoads 2021b). This has the two impacts on our project regarding car design and optimal suggested mounting position. It stresses the importance of integrating the Courtesy Light more completely to the design of the car such that the buttons could be integrated into the steering wheel in a similar fashion to how cruise-control buttons or multimedia control buttons are on many modern cars. In terms of mounting position, firstly, we would have to include a warning against mounting to anywhere in the airbag deployment zones as shown in Figure 1, and secondly, we would have to propose alternative positions that would still be very easily accessible to the driver and, ideally, operable without the need to remove the driver’s gaze from the road. The plans made as a result can be found in the plans and progress section.</p>" +
"<p>Figure 12: Typical airbag deployment zone and suggested device mounting locations.</p>" +
"<div><img src='./mounting_locations.png'></div>"+
"<p>Next, we had to tackle the issue that the Courtesy Light is (prepare yourself) a light. Delving into this topic we found that each state has their own rules regarding fitting of after-market LED devices. The laws and standards in these cases generally refer to hobbyist LED strip lighting for under glow effects, or the fitting of additional lights to bull bars and other often 4WD or camping related automobile accessories (Government of South Australia 2022) (Government of Western Australia). Both the Queensland and South Australian state government official documents mention that the lights should not be intended to obscure the vision of or ‘dazzle’ other road-users (Queensland Government 2021) (Government of South Australia 2020). In this situation, we are clear for use in the case of the Courtesy Light, but in order to show compliance to these conditions, fade timers and brightness control (day mode vs night mode for example) are proposed solutions/quality of life updates should they be required. </p>" +
"<p> Using Bluetooth to connect the app to the Courtesy Light device has potential to be a security risk if proper measures aren’t taken. Bluetooth technology is not fully secure and can be vulnerable to hacking, making it easier for attackers to access sensitive information transmitted through the app (Loveless, 2018). Connecting to a device through an app that uses Bluetooth can potentially compromise the security of both the device and the user's personal information stored on it. Bluetooth signals can also be disrupted by other electronic devices, resulting in a loss of connection or data transmission errors. Encryption and disabling Bluetooth when not in use are common preventative measures. The three security measures mentioned in the plans and progress section are; the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), implementation of LE Secure Connections and regular firmware updates. Successful implementation of these security measures will decrease the risk from third party attacks through the Bluetooth connection.   </p>" +
"<p>The final risk associated with the original Courtesy Light idea, again covered in the plans and progress section, involves the customisable message buttons. The Summary Offences act of 1988 states that ‘a person must not use offensive language in or near, or within hearing from a public place or a school’ (Prime Lawyers n.d.).  Unfortunately, human nature would dictate that a significant percentage of users would choose to use an LED display attached to their car to display vulgar or distasteful messages. In these situations, it is the context of the language used that is most important, as highlighted in an article in the Conversation (2020). At a children’s sporting event or morning commute, use of obscene language could get you into trouble, whereas at a packed pub on a Friday night, no one would see it worthy of any attention. </p>" +
"<p>Whilst the company would not be at fault in this case as it is the person’s intent that dictates the criminal nature of this offence (Prime Lawyers n.d.), allowing the users to choose from a curated list of options for the additional buttons would be a simple way of overcoming any such issues in the court of public opinion. Alternatively, with a user database and strict community guidelines in place, the threat of removal of the customisable message option from a user’s account (if they are found to be in breach of these guidelines) would likely be enough to keep most user’s custom messages from going too far. With the primary goal of the Courtesy Light to de-escalate and decrease the number of road rage incidences, the last thing we want is for the tool to be used to spark aggression between drivers.</p>" +

"<h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>" + 
"<p>Clear and effective communication is paramount to the success of any project, and group projects are no exception. A well-organized and planned communication plan ensures that all team members are on the same page and working towards the same goal. We will employ a variety of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools, such as face-to-face meetings, video conferencing via Microsoft teams, email, and instant messaging, as a group. Meetings will take place once a week, with additional meetings planned as needed. Meeting agendas and minutes will be distributed ahead of time to ensure that everyone is aware of the topics to be discussed as well as the tasks given to each team member. </p>" +
"<p>We will have a strategy in place to ensure that we can still make progress towards our goals if a team member does not reply to contact attempts. We will also establish a protocol for dealing with critical problems and how promptly responses are expected. We can ensure that the group remains focused, motivated, and productive throughout the project by establishing clear communication norms and expectations </p>" +

"<h2>Job Title: Mobile App Developer </h2>"+
"<p>For the development of the app, an app designer and app developer are needed. An app designer is the one responsible for creating the visual and user experience aspects of a mobile application. This includes its layout, user interface, and overall look and feel (Barrie, 2022). A developer, on the other hand, is responsible for writing the code that makes the app functional and brings the design to life. Having both a strong app designer and developer is crucial to the success of an app. This is because a well-designed app that is difficult to use or has technical issues will not be successful, and a functional app with poor design will not be well received by users. It's possible for an individual to be both an app designer and developer. This is particularly common in small app development teams. Since the app for the Courtesy Light is very simple, it could be made into a one-person role. This means that the developer would be considered a Full-Stack developer (Ready, 2018). A Full-Stack mobile app developer is responsible for designing and building the complete mobile application, including the user interface, and server-side logic. This means that they require a deep understanding of user-centred design and relevant programming languages. XCode and Android Studio, which are the IDEs used to develop the Courtesy Light app, are considered to be “Full-Stack” IDEs. In this case, the app developer would also require knowledge of Bluetooth technology, including the relevant Bluetooth APIs and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).  </p>"+

"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>I think that one thing that was beneficial to our group for this assignment was that everyone had a unique perspective and skillset to contribute to the assignment. Because of this, we were able to approach tasks in a variety of ways and contribute to areas we had personal interest in.  I also think that the group work for this assignment has helped me personally in terms of improving skills related to teamwork. </p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>On reflection, I believe that the way we divided up work did not make sense for what this assignment required. Early on we divided work based on sections. However, as time went on, I came to the realisation that it would be more logical for a few members to work on specific projects and bring their expertise to the project across all sections to ensure that the information remained consistent. For example, I did all of the work on the “app” part of this assignment, writing something about the app under each section. It became excessive when writing all of the app's details in addition to other sections, like the timeframe, skills and jobs, roles and creating the Figma prototype. In future group projects, I want to make sure that work is divided more mindfully from the beginning.   </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>I was surprised that the smaller group size wasn't too much of a hindrance on our team. I believe this is because it allowed everyone to make more meaningful contributions. Everyone was able to share their thoughts and their contributions were important to the final report.  </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learned that online group work can be just as productive as in-person group work. Our group was able to communicate well through Microsoft Teams, sharing ideas, working on our assignments and providing feedback on member’s contributions. Planning for things like meetings was also alright, once time zones are understood and members communicate their availability.  </p>" +


"<hr>"+

"<h2>Benjamin Turner</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>In my opinion, our overall group communication was great throughout the A3 process. That is not to say that it was an issue during A2 but as we were more familiar with each other and aware of each other’s strengths and skills it was far more comfortable to chat openly during meetings, direct messages, and via posts in Microsoft Teams." +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>I agree with what Nicole has written below regarding the way in which we divided up the work for this assessment as opposed to A2. Dividing the work up by section worked in the previous assignment as it was a lot more compartmentalised. The majority of the task for A3 was centred around the development of the Courtesy Light project which we subdivided amongst members. After commencing, we realised that there would be a lot more overlap between sections, and as a result, we decided to divide work by topic rather than report subheadings. This worked out fat better in the end as I once my content was written, I was able to focus a lot more on ensuring everyone else’s work flowed together to create a more cohesive report.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>I was surprised at how quickly we were able to adapt to losing a very active member (John) between A2 and A3. For the first couple of weeks, we were unsure as to what his situation was as no one had heard anything. We divided the work up as we did previously, leaving space for him with respect to the workload should he make a reappearance. This explains the rush of content updates we sent to GitHub later on in the assessment process as John played a big role in the website and GitHub management back in A2. Once it was apparent that he would not be returning, we were able to quickly fill in the gaps that we had left for him in the report and jump into the website edits.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learned to trust my fellow group members and the varied set of skills we as a group possess. Tasks as diverse as A2 and A3 seem extremely daunting to me personally, especially in the planning stages. This is mostly because I tend to plot out the required tasks in my head and come up with a gameplan for how I would tackle each aspect. Working with a group as great as the Kangaroos has taught me to trust the abilities of my team members and not mentally shoulder the burden of the entire task myself. The work produced by the team has far exceeded how I saw this project finishing up when planning it in my head. I am proud of what we have put together and need to remember for next time to trust the group members and the process.</p>" +

"<h2>Tarish Kapur</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>To accomplish the project, we successfully created clear goals and objectives for the assignment and collaborated well. The group members communicated effectively, allowing us to all comprehend the responsibilities allocated to us. Our major communication platform was Microsoft Teams, and we held weekly meetings with agendas and minutes. We also used Microsoft Teams to deliver updates regularly. Similarly, to assignment 2, the team shared their work via a shared template document and, ultimately, a shared document for submission. Because of our effective communication and collaboration, we were able to complete the assignment quickly and obtain the required results.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team's overall performance was exceptional, with no major issues to address. However, the loss of an active team member highlighted the need for better workload distribution. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>One of the surprising parts of this project was the team's level of structure. We worked together to complete a task list set out by one of the group members, this ensured that each member understood their roles and what needed to be accomplished.  </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>The success of a group's performance is frequently determined by its ability to effectively communicate and organise.

"<h2>Group Reflection </h2>"+
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>Throughout the assignment, the group worked well together and communicated efficiently. Each team member's different skill sets and views allowed for multiple approaches to problems, and everyone was able to participate in areas of personal interest. Clear goals and objectives were defined, and regular weekly meetings kept the group focused and organised. As a result, the group was capable of finishing the assignment efficiently and accomplish its set goals.</p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>Upon reflection of our group assignment, we all agreed that the work division could have been more carefully planned to ensure consistency throughout the project. Initially, work was divided into topics, but due to the loss of a team member, this caused some issues with workload distribution. One team member suggested that in the future, the work should be divided more carefully from the outset to avoid such problems. Another team member noted that some sections required more work than others and that it would have been beneficial to divide the workload more equitably in order to meet the deadline. Overall, the group performed well, but there is room for improvement in task assignment and workload distribution.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>The groups ability to handle the loss of an active member during the assignment was one of the assignments most surprising aspects. Despite the initial uncertainty and the absence of a group member, the team was able to quickly adapt and fill the gap in order to meet the deadline. The structure of the team also contributed to our success in dealing with this situation.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>Through this assignment, the group learned important lessons about effective teamwork, communication, and organisation. Trusting the varied set of skills of fellow group members, as well as learning to incorporate everyone’s individual strengths and weaknesses, allowed the team to work cohesively and accomplish tasks more efficiently. The success of the group was attributed to its ability to communicate well, stay organised, and understand each member’s duties and responsibilities. The experience also showed that online group work can be just as productive as in-person group work, as long as clear communication channels are established and meetings are planned in advance.</p>"+
