This combined with the ability to form simple strategy from complexity provides the team with valuable angles of attack towards the tasks required. Johns' personality type is open-minded but has a sense of responsibility to the team. John is also conscientious and is agreeable towards other ideas and thoughts, understanding the inner dynamics of a team, this helps the teamwork together, yet John provides leadership where it's required with a steady and controlled empathy to others within the team.

"<p>After reviewing the results its concluded that all three tests were relatively accurate towards my personality and work style. While the tests were true in some parts, it was inaccurate in other areas. The results of the Myers Brig test shows that I am an Advocate (INFJ-T). According to Myers-Briggs an advocate’s strengths are creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and altruistic. Through self-evaluation an advocate’s strengths do match my strengths. An advocate’s weaknesses are sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary, and prone to burnout. One aspect of the results I disagree with in the Myer-Briggs test is that advocates are perfectionistic. While I do believe its important to put in one hundred percent effort into my work, I do realize that we do not live in a perfect world and not everything can be perfect.</p>"+

"<p>All besides John’s CDO role (needing 20+ years' experience) require between 2-5 years of experience which is an accurate reflection of each team member’s life and career experience in and around the IT field. </p>"+
"<p>Surprisingly, only Ben and Tatsuya’s ideal jobs specifically require a tertiary degree, with Nicole and John’s jobs favouring proficiency in industry standard skills, and Tarish’s preferring industry standard security certifications (which admittedly do require some tertiary level education) (Meah,J. 2022). </p>"+
"<p>With regards to the skills required for each job Ben and Nicole’s related roles require similar language, tool and soft skills. Tatsuya’s requires similar soft skills but a more tailored tool and language set to that of a software dev role. Both John and Tarish have chosen roles that prioritise proficiency in soft skills (teamwork, leadership, experience) with assumed technical tool and language proficiency.   </p>"+
"<p>John is the Kangaroos member closest to being application ready for his ideal role.

"<h2>John Gude</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>As a group of people with varying backgrounds who had never met before, we came together and collaborated very well to complete the assignment within the scheduled deadlines. Our organisation and time management were our strengths.</p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>Decision making on what the project would be could have been improved and decisions made earlier in the process. However, the feasibility of the project was an early concern to the group and made deciding on the project more complex. The group used a voting system to get the consensus based on 3 concept ideas. It was decided through that medium that simplicity would be advantageous to us in the later stages should the concept idea need building.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>That the team didn’t require direct leadership. We all contributed effectively and were proactive on taking action to complete tasks that need doing rather than having someone assign tasks to them. This team was built on initiative and collective benefit which is unusual within a new group of people.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>People often play down or are not confident about their skills or what they can offer in group situations.</p>"+
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>The team used MS Teams as their primary communication platform. Weekly meetings were set up  along with meeting agenda and minutes, however MS teams chats was used as required during the week for general conversations and updates. Git updates messages were reflective of the updates by the team and were easy to understand and track. However, due to the configuration of the webpage, most updates were text based for the assignment sections rather than coding level updates. Access to Git and GitHub and teams was provided to all members while recordings etc were located on SharePoint, MS Teams repository. Alignment of GitHub updates and tasks allocated to team members during meetings mirrored very closely</p>" +

"<hr>"+

"<h2>Nicole Brooker</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>For this assignment, our group planned well ahead of when the assignment was due. This gave us plenty of time later on to organise and coordinate when we were working on more complicated parts of this assignment. The group has been able to effectively communicate through Microsoft Teams and everyone has been active and participated. </p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>While the group planned ahead, we took a decent amount of time to decide on a team project idea. This was largely due to discussion around what assignment 3 would require of our group and how everyone's interests and skill sets could be best utilised.   </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>Our group was able to work well despite obstacles faced. For example, we had a member leave within the first couple of weeks and the work that had been allocated to them was swiftly undertaken by another group member. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>One thing that I have learned about groups is the benefit of group work when people are engaged. Group members brought different perspectives through their work, which I think was a great benefit to our final assignment.   </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>Our group’s GitHub log is not necessarily a reflection on how our group worked for this assignment. This is due to our group making commits for small and large sections of this assignment and general troubleshooting taking up a generous number of commits.    </p>" +

"<hr>"+

"<h2>Benjamin Turner</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the kangaroos team early on decided to divide up the tasks between members based on our skillsets and interest areas. This proved to be a good decision as it minimised friction between team members in terms of our contributions and ensured we all had a set of tasks to perform.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>I think initially we were a bit reserved in terms of communication in Microsoft Teams and the meetings, but this got better once we began to get to know each other. We were also a bit hesitant in making group decisions regarding the project topic.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>I was honestly surprised at how open everyone was to help if other team members were having issues. I have worked in teams before where there was an expectation that we all made our contributions, but it was the burden of one or two to pick up the slack (nominated as editors or scribes for example), but here things have been very smooth with everyone working to their strengths.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learnt the value of open discussion regarding updating team other team members on progress of our sections. It ensures all team members are on the same page or can make adjustments to the workload if need be. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the GitHub activity log does not necessarily accurate trace of amount of work done by team members overall but it does show that we were all participating. Whether individuals decided to add their contributions in large batches, in a series of small commits, or had others upload their sections, the logs can make it seem like some team members did significantly more work than the others which is not the case.</p>" +
"<p>That said the group meeting discussion and meeting minutes documents are a closer reflection to how the work was divided amongst team members. We were quite active in the message forums within Microsoft Teams as well as regularly uploading our work into a shared template document and later a shared document for submission.</p>" +
"<hr>"+

"<h2>Tarish Kapur</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p> The team was able to come together effectively and establish clear goals and objectives for the assignment. Through effective communication among team members, they were able to understand the tasks assigned to them after the first meeting.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team performed exceptionally well and there were no major issues to be addressed. However, one suggestion for improvement would be in the decision-making process when selecting the group project. Initially, there was some uncertainty among the team, but they ultimately decided to use a voting poll to make the final decision. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>The team's organisation was a surprise to me. From the setup of GitHub pages to the structured meeting agendas, and the proactive attitude of each team member in completing assigned tasks. Additionally, the team's technical knowledge, particularly in coding and setting up GitHub pages was instrumental in the successful setup of the website. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>Clear communication and organisation are vital components for the success of any group. They can determine the effectiveness of the group's performance. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p> The team found the GitHub log to be user-friendly, and several members were proficient in its use. This made it easy to resolve any issues that arose during the assignment. </p>" +

"<hr>"+

"<h2>Tatsuya Rood'e</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p> I believe that our team “Kangaroos” is well organized and structured to accomplish our end goal as a team. The team has organized meetings, scheduled every week to allow us to assign and discuss certain topics about our assignment.  We have assigned roles that best suit to everyone’s strengths and weaknesses to efficiently contribute to our assignment.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team as a whole is dedicated and well organised with little room for improvement however, an area that I could have improved on would be my website development skills so I could have contributed more towards the development of the website. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>One thing that surprised me was the diversity of our group members and how we were able to work coherently as a team to accomplish our end goal. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learned that when working as a team we are able to overcome any challenges when we help and learn from each other as a team. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>It is evident that the whole team is contributing towards our assignment as we have a record of our teams Github log. By observing the activity log on Github we can see all members of the team have contributed within a week. This reassures that our team is working together to accomplish our end goal.   </p>" +
"<hr>"+

"<h2>Group Reflection </h2>"+
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>The team was able to allocate tasks for the assignment outputs based on early decisions to read each other's profiles created as part of assignment 1. This allowed us to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses and form an understanding of how to approach the assignment tasks as a team .The teams early agreement to use MS Teams as a standard communication medium, combined with regular meetings that were scheduled, the team was able to rely on each and every team member to support each other for general issues, understanding during the week. Due to the planning element of the teams, using meeting agendas, minutes and scheduled meetings, it allowed the team to produce a quality report and web page which employed all the teams input and skills.  </p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team worked exceptionally well together based on the limited time we had to come together as a group. The key improvement area we identified was decision making, with particular reference to the project idea. The team deferred the idea to later in the production of the assignment outputs, while this allowed the team to move forward on production of the document and webpages, it was also something that was of concern. The team rectified this by using a voting system, however it wasn't so much that the team members disagreed with ideas but more that the next assignment is linked to this idea and this caused us to re-think because of the lack of clarity. Despite this the team moved forward and chose an idea and shows how well the team have come together.  </p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>The surprising element to the team revolved around the diversity and efficiency of the group to work together as a group. The team members quickly came to the understanding that each one of us was able to offer skills and support to each other despite differing levels of skill against a specific area. Everyone had something that another team member needed and each member was willing and able to help.   </p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>The team learned more than anything both as a group and individually that groups require cooperation and understanding that each member is important. To be successful all team member need to be engaged and pro-active. This means to support each team member when needed and to contribute in multiple ways, advice, technical, emotionally or just being there to ask a question in some way. Much of our interactions were via messages so it really doesn't matter how the interactions in the group happen but that they do.  </p>"+
