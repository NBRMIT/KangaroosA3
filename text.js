"<p>After reviewing the results its concluded that all three tests were relatively accurate towards my personality and work style. While the tests were true in some parts, it was inaccurate in other areas. The results of the Myers Brig test shows that I am an Advocate (INFJ-T). According to Myers-Briggs an advocate’s strengths are creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and altruistic. Through self-evaluation an advocate’s strengths do match my strengths. An advocate’s weaknesses are sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary, and prone to burnout. One aspect of the results I disagree with in the Myer-Briggs test is that advocates are perfectionistic. While I do believe its important to put in one hundred percent effort into my work, I do realize that we do not live in a perfect world and not everything can be perfect.</p>"+

"<p>Across the Kangaroos 5 members there are 4 distinct disciplines or career paths mentioned. John seeking to enter a more managerial role as a Chief digital officer, Tatsuya looking to enter industry as a software developer, Tarish is after a position in cyber security and both Nicole and Ben’s ideal roles are similar within the field of data science (Nicole’s leaning towards data analysis, Ben’s towards data management). </p>"+
"<p>All besides John’s CDO role (needing 20+ years' experience) require between 2-5 years of experience which is an accurate reflection of each team member’s life and career experience in and around the IT field. </p>"+
"<p>Surprisingly, only Ben and Tatsuya’s ideal jobs specifically require a tertiary degree, with Nicole and John’s jobs favouring proficiency in industry standard skills, and Tarish’s preferring industry standard security certifications (which admittedly do require some tertiary level education) (Meah,J. 2022). </p>"+
"<p>With regards to the skills required for each job Ben and Nicole’s related roles require similar language, tool and soft skills. Tatsuya’s requires similar soft skills but a more tailored tool and language set to that of a software dev role. Both John and Tarish have chosen roles that prioritise proficiency in soft skills (teamwork, leadership, experience) with assumed technical tool and language proficiency.   </p>"+
"<p>John is the Kangaroos member closest to being application ready for his ideal role. The other 4 members are in the earlier stages of their IT careers and understandably lack the necessary skills required for their ideal jobs.

"<h4>App Development Story</h4>"+
"<p>Design for the app began during assignment 2. This included building a basic understanding of platforms, what would be included and what would be required to create an app to meet the requirements. It was decided that the app would be a native app for iOS and Android. This is because native apps can be distributed through the respective app stores, having met the compliance guidelines and regulations. For the iOS app, Swift will be the programming language and XCode will be the IDE. For the Android app, Java will be the programming language and Android Studio will be the IDE. The design of the app is focused on being user-centred. To achieve this, Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics will act as a guideline for the user interface. Nielsen's usability heuristics focus on simplicity and usability, which are key factors in designing a basic app (Nielsen 1994). The purpose of the app is to connect to the Courtesy Light device and allow the user to make two individualised messages that will be displayed on the device.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Research and Inspiration</b></p>" + 
"<p> When creating an app, it can be helpful to look to other successful apps for inspiration. From their user interface to their overall design elements, these apps can provide valuable insight into what makes an app user-friendly and engaging (Babich et al., 2021). By taking inspiration from the design elements and functionality from established apps, an app can be designed to be familiar to users and easier to understand, while still offering a unique value (Helios Design, 2022). The design of the Courtesy Light app was influenced by apps with user-friendly design interfaces and Bluetooth functionality. The Smart Life app, the Wo Mic app, and the Bose Connect app are a few examples of apps that have inspired the design of the Courtesy Light app.   </p>" +
"<p> Smart Life is a smartphone app that allows users to control their smart home devices (Volcano Technology Limited, 2023). The app connects to smart home devices via Bluetooth, making it simple for users to control their devices from anywhere. Smart Life's user interface aims to be simple and easy to understand, making it easy for users to control their devices using on-screen prompts with just a few steps. Wo Mic is a smartphone app that allows users to turn their smartphone into a wireless microphone for their computer (Wolicheng Tech, 2023). The app uses Bluetooth or Wi-Fi technology to connect the smartphone to the computer, allowing users to make use of the phone's microphone as a microphone for their laptop or desktop. The app has a minimalist design, with only the absolute necessary buttons and controls available to the user. Bose Connect is a smartphone app that allows users to control their Bose headphones and speakers (Bose Corporation, 2023). The app uses Bluetooth technology to connect the smartphone to the Bose devices. This connection allows users to control their audio and adjust settings from their smartphone. The user interface of Bose Connect is simple and has a specific focus on making it easy for users to control their audio devices through Bluetooth.   </p>" +
"<p> The design elements that have proven to be effective in these applications served as inspiration for the Courtesy Light app. This includes features such as Wo Mic’s minimalist design and Bose Connect’s fast and efficient Bluetooth connectivity. The Courtesy Light app's innovation stems primarily from its seamless integration with the Courtesy Light device. Utilising tried-and-true components, and adapting them to a new product we believe will be beneficial to a new audience. This, in turn, results in a one-of-a-kind benefit for the audience of the Courtesy Light.   </p>" +
"<p> Following the research and inspiration phase, I outlined who would be the user groups for the app to get a better understanding of what their requirements would be.  </p>" +

"<p><b>User Groups</b></p>" + 
"<p> Defining user groups is beneficial for app development because it helps developers to understand potential user’s needs and preferences. By identifying different user groups, developers can create user-centred designs that are tailored to specific user motivations, technological level and requirements. The three user groups I have identified for the Courtesy Light app are; New Users, Casual Users and Regular Users. </p>" +

"</table>"+

"<p> Following the defining of user groups, I had a better understanding of who I was making the app for. From this, I was able to begin the process of designing the app.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Design Side  </b></p>" + 
"<p>The design side of app development includes creating the look and feel of an application, as well as ensuring its usability and functionality. For the Courtesy Light app this has involved the creation of keypath scenarios and wireframes and the implementation of usability heuristics. </p>" +


"<h4>App Keypath Scenarios  </h4>" +
"<p>For the beginning of the design process, I created several keypath scenarios. Keypath scenarios are a design tool where you use a scenario to build a navigable path in the design (Lowdermilk, 2013). They are useful to app design because they help ensure that an app is designed with the user in mind. To create the keypath scenario, I started by identifying the primary tasks that users will perform in the app. Next, I mapped out the steps that a user would take to complete each task.  </p>" +
"<p>Once I created the keypath scenarios, I used them as a guide for the design and development of the app. They were beneficial in informing decisions about which features to include, how to present information, and how to make navigation intuitive. </p>" +

"<p><b>Scenario 1:</b> Connecting to the device for the first time </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>Ali opens the app and taps on the 'Settings' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali chooses the “Bluetooth” option from the menu.  </li>" +
"<li>The app searches for available Bluetooth devices and displays a list of them.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali selects the device he wants to connect to from the list.  </li>" +
"<li>The app sends a request to the device to establish a connection.  </li>" +
"<li>The device accepts the connection request, and the app displays a message indicating a successful connection.  </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<p><b>Scenario 2:</b> Connecting to the device that has been previously paired and writing a new custom message for the Courtesy Light </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>Ali opens the app and taps on the 'Settings' button.  </li>" +
"<li>The app automatically connects to the device that has been previously paired as it is saved in the app's memory.  </li>" +
"<li>The app displays a message indicating a successful connection.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali returns to the app’s home screen through the navigation bar.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali taps the 'Customise' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali taps on the 'Change Message' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali types a message into the app and presses save.  </li>" +
"<li>The app sends a request to the device to change the message it's displaying.  </li>" +
"<li>The device receives the request, updates the message, and sends a confirmation to the app.  </li>" +
"<li>The app displays a message indicating a successful message change.  </li>" +
"</ol>"+

"<p> Once I created the keypath scenarios, I used them as a guide for the design and development of the app. They were beneficial in informing decisions about which features to include, how to present information, and how to make navigation intuitive.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</b></p>" + 
"<p> Following the creation of keypath scenarios, I created a series of low-fidelity wireframes to ensure that I could fit the scenarios into the app's design. Low-fidelity wireframes are less detailed than the final design and don't focus on visual elements (Laubheimer, 2016). This allows for focusing on the layout, navigation, and functionality of the app. This also means that you are able to easily make changes before it's too late in the process. Overall, low-fidelity wireframes are beneficial for app design because they provide a fast way to explore design concepts early in the design process. </p>" +
"<div><img src='./wireframe_image.JPG'></div>"+
"<p> Following the development of the low-fidelity wireframes, they were tested against the keypath scenarios. The keypath scenarios suggested a few minor modifications that needed to be made. Making these modifications was a simple process, thanks to the simplicity of low-fidelity wireframes. Modifications included the addition of a save and clear button in the customisation menu and access to notification settings. Once these modifications were made, I began work on the app prototype.   </p>" +


"<p><b>App Prototype </b></p>" + 
"<p> The app prototype features the navigation and functionality of the app. Once the wireframes were completed, I began adding more detail to the prototypes using Figma's design tools. This included adding colours, images, and other visual elements to make the app look more polished.   </p>" +
"<p> Once the design was complete, I used Figma's prototyping tools to create a prototype that is able to simulate the app's user flow. This is an important step in the development process because it allows for testing and refining the app's design before the final app is built. This step also involved adding interactions and animations, which help to make the app feel more engaging and dynamic.  </p>" +
"<p> This is the link to the full Figma prototype: <a href='https://www.figma.com/file/FJrR4kTfKRryLjKs51xvq0/Intro-App-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1&t=1BxME1avgTbCQ0Vr-1'></a> Figma Prototype </p>" +

"<div><img src='./prototype_image.JPG'></div>"+



"<h5>Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics </h5>" +
"<p>For assignment 2, it was mentioned that the app’s user interface design would follow Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics. Below is an outline of how each of these heuristics is important in app design and how they each were integrated into the prototype’s UI design. </p>" +

"<p><b>1. Visibility of System Status  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_1.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Visibility of system status is important in app design because when users perform an action within an app, they expect to receive immediate feedback about the status of their request. If the system status is not visible, users may become confused, frustrated or assume that their action was not processed. </p>" +

"<p><b>2. Match Between System and the Real World  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_2.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Matching the system and the real world is important in app design because it helps create a smooth user experience. Users are better able to comprehend and navigate an app when its behaviour and interface reflect how people think and interact with the world.  </p>" +

"<p><b>3. User Control and Freedom  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_3.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>User control and freedom are important in app design as they give users the power to determine how they interact with the app. Accessibility can also be improved by allowing users to adjust the app to better meet their individual needs through user control and freedom. </p>" +

"<p><b>4. Consistency and Standards  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_4.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Consistency and standards are important in app design because they provide users with a clear and predictable experience. When an app follows established design patterns, users can understand how the app works and can easily navigate through it.  </p>" +

"<p><b>5. Error Prevention  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_5.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Error prevention is important in app design because it helps to minimise the risk of users making mistakes while using the app. This was accomplished by providing confirmations prior to carrying out potentially unintended actions, and by using the help and information page.  </p>" +

"<p><b>6. Recognition Rather than Recall  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_6.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>By prioritising recognition in app design, designers can create apps that are easy to navigate. This will reduce the cognitive load on the users. When users can recognise elements within an app, such as icons, buttons, and navigation, they are able to quickly and efficiently complete tasks without having to rely on their memory of where specific information is located. Recall, however, requires users to remember specific information, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.  </p>" +

"<p><b>7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_7.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Flexibility and efficiency of use are important in app design because they allow users to easily accomplish their goals. The app has been designed to be efficient and save users time and effort by using an intuitive interface. Users will be more likely to continue using an app if they can complete tasks quickly and easily. </p>" +

"<p><b>8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_8.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Aesthetic and minimalist design is important in app design because it can improve the user experience by making the app visually appealing and easy to navigate. Aesthetic design creates a positive first impression. Minimalist design, on the other hand, focuses on simplicity. This means reducing clutter and making it easier for users to focus on the most important elements of the app. The app has been designed to meet these heuristics through the visual design.   </p>" +

"<p><b>9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_9.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Helping users to recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors is important in app design because by providing clear error messages, users can quickly identify a problem and take steps to resolve them. This will reduce frustration for the user, making them enjoy using the app. When users can quickly identify the source of an error, they can take appropriate action to resolve the issue. In addition, providing users with self-help options, such as a FAQ, can help to solve issues without having to seek assistance from others. The Courtesy Light app provides a full FAQ and information on the device specifications.   </p>" +

"<p><b>10. Help and Documentation  </b></p>" +
"<div><img src='./usability_10.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>Help and documentation are important in app design because they provide users with the information and support they need to effectively use the app. Clear and concise documentation can help users understand  how to complete specific tasks. Having access to a help section will also reduce the likelihood of errors.   </p>" +


"<p><b>Technical side </b></p>" + 
"<p>The technical side of app development includes choosing a development platform, programming language, and implementing features. For the Courtesy Light app this has included the implementation of Bluetooth, security, and notification functions. </p>" +

"<p><b>Database Management</b></p>" + 
"<p>The Courtesy Light app will be using SQLite as the database management system to store and manage data. SQLite is a relational database management system (RDBMS) (SQLite, 2021). In technical terms, this allows an app to store information in a SQLite database by using SQL statements to create tables and insert, update, or retrieve data from those tables.  </p>" +
"<p>Here is an overview of what that process will involve for the Courtesy Light app (SQLite Tutorial, 2022): </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>The app will establish a connection to the SQLite database. This involves opening the database file on the device and creating a connection object that can be used to interact with the database. </li>" +
"<li>The app will create a schema for the database by using SQL statements to define the structure of the tables. This will involve the columns demonstrated below. </li>" +
"<li>The app will insert data into the tables by using SQL INSERT statements. This involves specifying the values for each column in the table and then executing the statement to insert the data into the database. </li>" +
"<li>The app will also retrieve the data from the tables by using SQL SELECT statements. This involves specifying the columns and conditions for the data to be retrieved, and executing the statement to retrieve the data from the database. </li>" +
"<li>The app will be able to update data in the tables by using SQL UPDATE statements. This involves specifying the columns and conditions for the data to be retrieved and executing the statement to update the data in the database. </li>" +
"<li>The app will delete data from the tables by using SQL DELETE statements. This involves specifying the columns and conditions for the data to be retrieved and executing the statement to be deleted from the data in the database. </li>" +
"</ol>"+

"<p>Below is an example of what the code for table creation will look like: </p>" +
"<div><img src='./SQL_example.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>The table in this is called “CL_device_messages”, an identifiable name for the purpose of the table. The code has three columns for the database; device_id, message_1 and message_2. The reason behind these identifiers is outlined below: </p>" +
"<p>CL_device_messages: The title of the table. </p>" +
"<p>device_id: The identifier of the device that the message is stored on. </p>" +
"<p>message_1: The text of the first message that can be stored. </p>" +
"<p>message_2: The text of the second message that can be stored. </p>" +


"<p><b>Notification Feature </b></p>" + 
"<p>The Courtesy Light app will contain a notification service to alert the user to any changes made within the app. Notifications are an important part of the Courtesy Light app because they act as an alert to the user about changes in the status of the system and alert the user to any events that have occurred. The purpose that notifications serve is to keep the user informed about what is happening in the system in real-time, without the need for the user to actively seek out this information (Salazar, 2015). They also provide the user with a quick and convenient way to take action if need be. All of this can be related back to the first usability heuristic outlined earlier: visibility of system status. There are two types of notifications that the Courtesy Light app will send; push notifications and in-app notifications.  </p>" +
"<p>Push notifications are messages sent by apps that can appear on a smartphone device at any time. These notifications are part of both iOS or Android devices, with both systems having built-in tools to develop a push notification system. Push notifications are able to appear on the lock screen and in the notification centre, even if the app is not currently in use. The Courtesy Light app will include push notifications to alert the user to important updates to the device or messages from the Courtesy Light team. When an app sends a push notification, the following process occurs (Salesforce, 2022) (Ibrahim, 2021) (Bhardwaj, 2020): </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>The app generates a notification payload. The notification payload consists of the message text, title, and any additional data needed. </li>" +
"<li>The app uses the respective push notification services; Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS and Firebase for Android.</li>" +
"<li>The app registers with the push notification service and receives a unique device token.</li>" +
"<li>The app server sends a request to the push notification service. This will include the device token and the notification payload. </li>" +
"<li>The push notification service receives the API request and sends the notification payload to the device which is associated with the device token.  </li>" +
"<li>The device receives the notification payload and displays the notification to the user.</li>" +
"<li>The user interacts with the notification. The app then retrieves and executes the additional information included in the notification payload, if there is any. </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<div><img src='./push_flow.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>In-app notifications are messages sent by an app to the user while they are actively using the app on their iOS or Android device. The Courtesy Light app will include in-app notifications concerning changes to the Bluetooth connection and changes to the message display. These notifications will be displayed as pop-up alerts within the app interface. Unlike push notifications, in-app notifications do not appear on the lock screen or in the notification centre. When an app sends an in-app notification, the following process occurs (Salesforce, 2022) (Microsoft Learn, 2023):</p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>The app generates a notification payload. The notification payload consists of the message text, title, and any additional data needed. </li>" +
"<li>The app's code determines when to show the notification, based on when certain events occur within the app, such as the user selecting 'Bluetooth' or changing the messages in the app. </li>" +
"<li>The app sends a request to the REST API to retrieve the notification payload.</li>" +
"<li>The app then analyses the notification payload and displays the notification to the user within the app's interface.</li>" +
"<li>When the user interacts with the notification, the back-end will be updated with the new status (e.g. read and accepted or dismissed). </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<div><img src='./notif_flow.JPG'></div>"+

"<p><b>Bluetooth </b></p>" + 
"<p>Building on from assignment 2, the Courtesy Light device and app will connect to each other via Bluetooth. This will be a process done through collaboration with the SQLite Database. When the Courtesy Light device and app connect via Bluetooth, they will be able to exchange data with each other (Gomez et al., 2012). </p>" +
"<p>To use Bluetooth in the app, the app must first be granted permission from the user. The process for granting Bluetooth access for app notifications is slightly different on Android devices compared to iOS. On Android devices, the user can find the app's Bluetooth permissions in their smartphone's settings (Android Help, 2023). Here they can either allow or deny the Courtesy Light access to their Bluetooth. On iOS devices, the user will be prompted with an in-app notification asking for permission to turn on Bluetooth for the Courtesy Light (Apple Support, 2022). For the Bluetooth connection, the app will discover the Bluetooth serial module attached to the Courtesy Light device, and establish a Bluetooth connection with it. This will be done using the Bluetooth libraries; Android's Bluetooth API and iOS's Core Bluetooth framework. Once this connection is established, the app can communicate with the device over the Bluetooth connection. This will include the sending and receiving data through the SQLite database.  </p>" +
"<p>The following steps show the flow of data from the app, to the database, to the Courtesy Light device: </p>" +
"<ol>"+

"<p><b>Security</b></p>" + 
"<p>Security is an important consideration when creating the Courtesy Light app because it helps to protect user information, and prevents unauthorised access. The use of Bluetooth technology creates a need for security measures to ensure that the Courtesy Light app data and device are protected (Padgette et al., 2022). There are several ways that security will be implemented for the Courtesy Light, including the use of Bluetooth Low Energy, LE Secure Connections and regular firmware updates.  </p>" +
"<p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is good for security because it uses encryption algorithms to secure data transmission, making it difficult for outsiders to intercept and decode data (Li & Cui, 2019). Additionally, BLE uses short-range communication. This limits the range of communication available and reduces the risk of interference from any unauthorised devices. BLE also has several built-in security features that can be used to encrypt data and protect against unauthorised access, such as LE Secure Connections.</p>" +
"<p>LE Secure Connections is another security measure for establishing a secure Bluetooth connection. LE Secure Connections is a security feature that was introduced in Bluetooth version 4.2 (Ren, 2022). It works by generating a private and a public key on each device. The public keys are then used to exchange and verify information during the pairing process. Once the devices are paired, the connection is encrypted using a shared secret key. This key is generated by combining the public and private keys of both devices. This process will, in turn, protect against any potential security threats. LE Secure Connections is supported on both Android and iOS devices that are compatible with BLE 4.2. </p>" +
"<p>Updating the device's firmware is also good for security, because it works to fix vulnerabilities in the software that could otherwise be exploited (Bettayeb et al., 2019). As new security threats are discovered, firmware updates are released to address these issues, and improve the security of the device. By installing the latest firmware updates, users can make sure that their devices have the most up-to-date security features and that they are protected against known security threats. The Courtesy Light app will also require updates as the security standards change for iOS and Android devices. </p>" +

"<p><b>Publishing </b></p>" + 
"<p>The app will be published to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The publishing process for each differs slightly.</p>" +
"<p>To publish an app on the Apple App Store, you need to register as an iOS developer and create an Apple Developer account (Apple Inc., 2023). An app listing in App Store Connect, which is Apple's portal for managing your app, will then need to be created. This listing will include adding details such as the app name, description, and screenshots. The price for the Courtesy Light app will be free, with the cost of development being factored into the pricing of the Courtesy Light device. Once the app is ready, it can be submitted for review to the App Store. During the process of reviewing an app, Apple typically takes a few days to verify that it complies with Apple's App Store Guidelines and is free of bugs and other issues. Once the app has been approved, it will be available for download on the Apple App Store. </p>" +
"<p>To publish an app on the Google Play Store, you need to register as an Android developer and create a Google Play Developer account (Android, 2023). A new app listing on the Google Play Console will need to be created after the account has been set up (Google Play, 2023). This requires the information about the app, such as its title, description, and screenshots. The APK file will also need to be uploaded for review. The APK file is the package of the app's code and resources. This is also the time to set the app's pricing and distribution options. This will match the details from the Apple App Store publishing. Because the app is a native app, it will have met Google Play's policies and guidelines. Once all of these details are complete, the app is ready to be submitted for review. The review process for Android apps will typically take a few days. Once the app has been approved, it will be available for download on the Google Play Store. </p>" +

"<p><b>Maintenance and Update Compatibility  </b></p>" + 
"<p>Maintenance and update compatibility are important factors to consider when creating an app. Maintenance is important for any application because it ensures that the app remains secure, stable, efficient, and relevant for its users. User feedback is an important part of the creation of any application as it provides developers with a 2-way communication channel with their user base. It is an important tool for ensuring that The Courtesy Light app is meeting the needs of its users. This helps with making data-driven decisions about how to improve the app. User feedback will be collected within the app, through the support email on the Help and Information page. The updates for the app will be centred around what the feedback has told the development team. The type of feedback users will be able to provide from within the app will include reporting any errors that they have encountered and any recommendations they may have (Singh 2020). The user feedback feature will also follow Nielsen's heuristics guidelines and be simple and easy to use, making the option to provide feedback accessible.  The feedback that is received will also provide the developers with more detailed information on how users are interacting with the app and Courtesy Light device. </p>" +

"<p><b>Future Steps </b></p>" + 
"<p>Now that the design prototype has been tested and refined, and the technical aspects have been discussed, the Courtesy Light app can be turned into a real application. Figma's code export feature allows developers to generate the assets needed for the app (Figma Help Center, 2022). From this, these assets will be used to build the app through the Xcode and Android Studio IDEs. Before the app is released, it will need to go through thorough testing to ensure that it works as expected, and to fix any bugs or glitches. Testing for the app is explained further in the testing section of this assignment.  </p>" +

"<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions </b></p>" + 
"<p>The app information page includes a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section. The FAQ is designed to answer any questions the user may have in regard to using the app, and allows the user to resolve any issues they may have. A copy of the text from the FAQ is printed below. </p>" +
"<p>Q: What kind of devices does the app work with? \n A: The app is designed to work with the Courtesy Light device, which can be connected through Bluetooth. </p>" +

"<p>The developers will be using the latest stable release for the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Using the latest stable release is beneficial because it contains the latest improvements (Humble & Farley, 2010). This may include new features and functionality that will make the development process easier. Using the most recent stable release is also likely to have improved compatibility with the most recent libraries, technologies, and tools. This is particularity crucial for the Courtesy Light's Bluetooth API compatibility.   </p>" +

"<h3>Testing</h3>" +
"<p>After we develop the idea ourselves, with all of the features and design capabilities to handle the use-cases we see fit, we will conduct a survey (created via free online tool Survey Monkey) in order to gather feedback from the general public. The questions in this survey will cover people’s past experience with road rage, the likelihood of consumers taking up a product like the Courtesy Light, what types of transport they use, and what potential extra features they would like to see from a product like the Courtesy Light that could potentially be implemented into future revisions. This survey can be accessed via the following link <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3KVYVQS'> https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3KVYVQS</a>. </p>" +
"<p>Market testing or beta testing is a critical stage in bringing a product to market. It involves testing the product with a smaller group of potential customers or early adopters to gather feedback and make any necessary improvements before the releasing the product to the full market (Teel 2016). Bringing a new product to the market is costly so it is paramount that concept development & testing along with market testing is done to extract as much feedback and data for the focused market. The demographic to target for the courtesy light is car owners who want to convey appreciation and gratitude to other drivers on the road. Additionally, the product can appeal to individuals who want a simple and user-friendly way to improve road safety by drawing attention to reckless driving behaviours. The strategy that projects team has decided on here is to conduct a survey targeted towards ride sharing drivers and delivery partners, such as Uber and Lyft, that can help to gather important feedback on the idea and gauge interest in participating in the concept testing. A full working week for an average uber driver is around 37.4 hours according to Alexander et al. (2022).  </p>" +
"<p>We believe that because they spend a significant amount of time on the road and are more likely to have noticed a gap in the market for this product, this demographic will be ideal for contributing to our testing phase. The results of the survey, feedback from the concept testing phase, and any additional data and insights gathered through market research will be included in our acceptance criteria for this project. Our acceptance criteria for this project will be based on three key factors: Functionality, Performance, and Usability/Compatibility. Our goal is to ensure that the product meets the needs and expectations of our target market and performs well in real-world scenarios. The data and feedback collected through our survey and concept testing phase will be used to evaluate the product's functionality and performance, while user experience and compatibility with different car models and road conditions will also be taken into consideration. Ultimately, we aim to develop a product that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of our target market and contributes to road safety. Survey Monkey, a popular survey tool, will be used to collect data and insights from our target demographic. </p>" +
"<p>This information will help us determine the product's potential success and guide the next steps in its development and commercialisation. In addition, we will assess the product's ability to meet customer expectations and provide a positive user experience. This will be done during the concept testing phase, in which we will create 6-8 concept designs and distribute them to Uber drivers who expressed interest in participating via the survey. We will collect feedback from participants on their experience with the concepts, including usability, design, and overall satisfaction, using survey monkey once more. This data will be used to improve the design during subsequent product development and, ultimately, to bring the product to market with confidence that it will meet the needs and expectations of its target audience. The ultimate goal of this project is to bring to market a product that solves a problem and adds value to its target audience. We will consider the project successful if it meets the requirements and standards outlined in the project plan and passes all tests with few or no errors. Additionally, user feedback and acceptance of the final product will be used to determine project success. </p>" +
"<h4>App Development Testing </h4>" +
"<p>App testing is an essential part of software development and a crucial step in ensuring the quality and usability of an application. App testing is an iterative process (Unadkat, 2022), and it is important to repeat the testing process multiple times to ensure that the app is of high quality and meets the needs of the users. There are several stages of app testing, including unit testing, functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user testing (Android, 2022). These types of testing all require a different approach in order to test the app’s functionality.  </p>" +
"<p>Unit testing involves testing individual components of an app to ensure they function as expected in isolation. This type of testing helps identify and fix any bugs or errors in the early stages of development (Muccini et al., 2012). This will make it easier to catch and fix problems before they have the chance to get worse. Functional testing is the process of verifying that an app meets its specified requirements and functions as intended. During functional testing, the app is tested in different scenarios, such as different input combinations, different screen sizes, and different operating systems. This is done to make sure it works as expected under different conditions. Performance testing is the process of evaluating an app’s performance and behaviour under real-world conditions. This type of testing is designed to identify performance bottlenecks and other issues that may impact the user experience. This includes things such as slow load times, long wait times, or poor app responsiveness. Security testing is performed to evaluate the app's security features and to identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers or attackers. User testing is the final step in the testing process, where the app is tested by users to ensure that it meets their requirements and expectations. This is done as part of a beta or market research test. We have outlined our plans to conduct this type of testing elsewhere in this section.  </p>" +
"<p>Concerning the testing that has been done so far for the Courtesy Light app, all testing has been within the unit testing and functional testing stages. This is because the prototype created for this assignment is UI design based, rather than programming based. Further development on the app would require completing other stages of testing to take place to ensure a fully functional and efficient app. Testing has included creation of keypath scenarios and low-fidelity wireframes. These were created to ensure that the user goals can be accomplished through the app. Low-Fidelity wireframes are beneficial to the testing process because they are a cheap and easy way to test functionality. By creating a simple and rough outline of the app's structure, it was easy to identify and address any potential issues with the layout, navigation, and overall user experience. This allowed for faster prototyping, resulting in a smoother design process. The testing for the app also involved creating several keypath scenarios. These scenarios were concerned with achieving the user’s goals for using the app. When tested, the keypath scenarios worked effectively with the wireframes. This suggests that the design has so far proven functional.   </p>" +

"<h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>" + 
"<p>Clear and effective communication is paramount to the success of any project, and group projects are no exception. A well-organized and planned communication plan ensures that all team members are on the same page and working towards the same goal. We will employ a variety of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools, such as face-to-face meetings, video conferencing via Microsoft teams, email, and instant messaging, as a group. Meetings will take place once a week, with additional meetings planned as needed. Meeting agendas and minutes will be distributed ahead of time to ensure that everyone is aware of the topics to be discussed as well as the tasks given to each team member. </p>" +
"<p>We will have a strategy in place to ensure that we can still make progress towards our goals if a team member does not reply to contact attempts. We will also establish a protocol for dealing with critical problems and how promptly responses are expected. We can ensure that the group remains focused, motivated, and productive throughout the project by establishing clear communication norms and expectations </p>" +

"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the kangaroos team early on decided to divide up the tasks between members based on our skillsets and interest areas. This proved to be a good decision as it minimised friction between team members in terms of our contributions and ensured we all had a set of tasks to perform.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>I think initially we were a bit reserved in terms of communication in Microsoft Teams and the meetings, but this got better once we began to get to know each other. We were also a bit hesitant in making group decisions regarding the project topic.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>I was honestly surprised at how open everyone was to help if other team members were having issues. I have worked in teams before where there was an expectation that we all made our contributions, but it was the burden of one or two to pick up the slack (nominated as editors or scribes for example), but here things have been very smooth with everyone working to their strengths.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learnt the value of open discussion regarding updating team other team members on progress of our sections. It ensures all team members are on the same page or can make adjustments to the workload if need be. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the GitHub activity log does not necessarily accurate trace of amount of work done by team members overall but it does show that we were all participating. Whether individuals decided to add their contributions in large batches, in a series of small commits, or had others upload their sections, the logs can make it seem like some team members did significantly more work than the others which is not the case.</p>" +
"<p>That said the group meeting discussion and meeting minutes documents are a closer reflection to how the work was divided amongst team members. We were quite active in the message forums within Microsoft Teams as well as regularly uploading our work into a shared template document and later a shared document for submission.</p>" +

"<h2>Tarish Kapur</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>To accomplish the project, we successfully created clear goals and objectives for the assignment and collaborated well. The group members communicated effectively, allowing us to all comprehend the responsibilities allocated to us. Our major communication platform was Microsoft Teams, and we held weekly meetings with agendas and minutes. We also used Microsoft Teams to deliver updates regularly. Similarly, to assignment 2, the team shared their work via a shared template document and, ultimately, a shared document for submission. Because of our effective communication and collaboration, we were able to complete the assignment quickly and obtain the required results.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team performed exceptionally well and there were no major issues to be addressed. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>One of the surprising parts of this project was the team's level of structure. We worked together to complete a task list set out by one of the group members, this ensured that each member understood their roles and what needed to be accomplished.  </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>The success of a group's performance is frequently determined by its ability to effectively communicate and organise. Clear communication and organisation were the key pillars of our project's success. We were able to reduce the likelihood of errors and avoid unnecessary delays by ensuring that every team member understood their duties and responsibilities. It is evident that effective communication and organisation are critical components for any group's success. They lay the groundwork for a team to work together, stay focused, and complete the project on schedule and to a high standard. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p> The team found the GitHub log to be user-friendly, and several members were proficient in its use. This made it easy to resolve any issues that arose during the assignment. </p>" +

"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>It is evident that the whole team is contributing towards our assignment as we have a record of our teams Github log. By observing the activity log on Github we can see all members of the team have contributed within a week. This reassures that our team is working together to accomplish our end goal.   </p>" +
"<hr>"+

"<h2>Group Reflection </h2>"+
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>The team was able to allocate tasks for the assignment outputs based on early decisions to read each other's profiles created as part of assignment 1. This allowed us to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses and form an understanding of how to approach the assignment tasks as a team .The teams early agreement to use MS Teams as a standard communication medium, combined with regular meetings that were scheduled, the team was able to rely on each and every team member to support each other for general issues, understanding during the week. Due to the planning element of the teams, using meeting agendas, minutes and scheduled meetings, it allowed the team to produce a quality report and web page which employed all the teams input and skills.  </p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team worked exceptionally well together based on the limited time we had to come together as a group. The key improvement area we identified was decision making, with particular reference to the project idea. The team deferred the idea to later in the production of the assignment outputs, while this allowed the team to move forward on production of the document and webpages, it was also something that was of concern. The team rectified this by using a voting system, however it wasn't so much that the team members disagreed with ideas but more that the next assignment is linked to this idea and this caused us to re-think because of the lack of clarity. Despite this the team moved forward and chose an idea and shows how well the team have come together.  </p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>The surprising element to the team revolved around the diversity and efficiency of the group to work together as a group. The team members quickly came to the understanding that each one of us was able to offer skills and support to each other despite differing levels of skill against a specific area. Everyone had something that another team member needed and each member was willing and able to help.   </p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>The team learned more than anything both as a group and individually that groups require cooperation and understanding that each member is important. To be successful all team member need to be engaged and pro-active. This means to support each team member when needed and to contribute in multiple ways, advice, technical, emotionally or just being there to ask a question in some way. Much of our interactions were via messages so it really doesn't matter how the interactions in the group happen but that they do.  </p>"+
