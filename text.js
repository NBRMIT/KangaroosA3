This combined with the ability to form simple strategy from complexity provides the team with valuable angles of attack towards the tasks required. Johns' personality type is open-minded but has a sense of responsibility to the team. John is also conscientious and is agreeable towards other ideas and thoughts, understanding the inner dynamics of a team, this helps the teamwork together, yet John provides leadership where it's required with a steady and controlled empathy to others within the team.

"<p>After reviewing the results its concluded that all three tests were relatively accurate towards my personality and work style. While the tests were true in some parts, it was inaccurate in other areas. The results of the Myers Brig test shows that I am an Advocate (INFJ-T). According to Myers-Briggs an advocate’s strengths are creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and altruistic. Through self-evaluation an advocate’s strengths do match my strengths. An advocate’s weaknesses are sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary, and prone to burnout. One aspect of the results I disagree with in the Myer-Briggs test is that advocates are perfectionistic. While I do believe its important to put in one hundred percent effort into my work, I do realize that we do not live in a perfect world and not everything can be perfect.</p>"+

"<p>All besides John’s CDO role (needing 20+ years' experience) require between 2-5 years of experience which is an accurate reflection of each team member’s life and career experience in and around the IT field. </p>"+
"<p>Surprisingly, only Ben and Tatsuya’s ideal jobs specifically require a tertiary degree, with Nicole and John’s jobs favouring proficiency in industry standard skills, and Tarish’s preferring industry standard security certifications (which admittedly do require some tertiary level education) (Meah,J. 2022). </p>"+
"<p>With regards to the skills required for each job Ben and Nicole’s related roles require similar language, tool and soft skills. Tatsuya’s requires similar soft skills but a more tailored tool and language set to that of a software dev role. Both John and Tarish have chosen roles that prioritise proficiency in soft skills (teamwork, leadership, experience) with assumed technical tool and language proficiency.   </p>"+
"<p>John is the Kangaroos member closest to being application ready for his ideal role.

"<h1><i class='fa-solid fa-chart-line fa-xl'></i> Industry Data</h1>" + 
"<p>Understanding job market demand is, for many people, a key factor in deciding what field they want to go into. According to ACS Australia’s Digital Pulse (2022), there has reportedly been an 8.0% growth in technology related employment in Australia. In comparison, there has been a 6.4% growth in overall jobs. This means that as of 2021, there are 870,268 people who are employed in the technology workforce. Current projections suggest that there will be 1 million technology workers in Australia by 2024 and 1.2 million by 2027. While the technology industry is growing overall in Australia, some occupations are growing more rapidly than others. Taking into consideration what skills are in high demand is beneficial to those who are looking to go into the industry. These skills are applied to IT specific related skills as well as general skills. This analysis of industry data will outline what the current technology industry looks like in Australia as well as what is currently projected for the future of the industry. </p>"+
"<p>The job titles for this group are: </p>"+
"<ul>"+
"<li>Ben: Data Engineer</li>"+
"<li>John: Chief Digital Officer </li>"+
"<li>Nicole: Data Scientist </li>"+
"<li>Tarish: Security Analyst </li>"+
"<li>Tatsuya: Software Developer</li>"+
"</ul>"+
"<p>Disclaimer: This analysis will attempt to use these exact titles, however if the title is not available it will replace it with a functional equivalent for comparison. The job title grouping for this analysis is based on the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupation (ANZSCO) occupational categories. ANZSCO provides a standard classification system that allows for consistent and accurate data collection, analysis, and reporting across multiple industries and sectors. The group codes classify occupations according to five levels: major group, sub-major group, minor group, unit group, and occupation. The job titles for this analysis are all unit group level to make them appropriately comparable. </p>"+

"<h2>Groups Required Skill Set </h2>" + 
"<h3>IT Specific Skills </h3>" + 
"<p>Listed below are some of the IT Specific related skills required for the group’s jobs. These skills were listed by the group members during the ideal job section of Assignment One. The data used for the analysis is from Burning Glass (2018) and it is based on how in demand these skills are. Demand is based on the frequency of these skills appearing in job postings from Dec 24 2017 - Mar 23 2018.</p>"+
"<p>SQL, JavaScript, Windows, UNIX, Linux, Java, C#, .Net, Python, R, SAS, Project Management, and Business Analysis. </p>"+

"<p><b>Findings</b>: The three highest in demand IT Specific skills are: SQL, JavaScript and JAVA. All of these skills appeared in job ads over 2800 times. These skills are all “programming” related, which aligns with the previous section ranking Software and Applications Programmers as the most in demand occupation.</p>"+
"<h3>General Skills </h3>" + 
"<p>Listed below are some of the General skills required for the group’s jobs. These skills were listed in the ideal jobs section of the group member’s previous assignment. The data is from Burning Glass (2018) and it is based on how in demand these skills are. Demand is based on the frequency of these skills appearing in postings from Dec 24 2017 - Mar 23 2018. </p>"+
"<p>Communication Skills, Problem Solving, Organisation Skills, Business Management, Leadership, Building Relationships, Planning, Troubleshooting, Analytical Skills, Meeting Deadlines</p>"+
"<div><img src='./generalskills.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>[ This chart ranks the three highest in demand General skills ]</p>"+
"<p><b>Findings</b>: The three highest in demand General skills are: Communication Skills, Problem Solving and Organisational Skills. Communication skills are the highest in demand, appearing 27,922 times more than the second highest in demand. These skills may apply to all the listed occupations, so it would be beneficial for all members to work on these skills.  </p>"+
"<p><b>Conclusion</b>: Concerning demand, the skills listed in the group’s previous assignments are seen through the general skills section more than the IT Specific skills section. The most in demand IT Specific skills are related to programming-oriented occupations, similar to the findings in the job rankings section. It should be noted, however, that only showing the ranking of the “top three” skills does not fully grasp the entirety of skills that are in demand or becoming increasingly sought after.</p>"+

"<h2>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>" + 
"<p>Ben: My opinion of my ideal job has not necessarily changed but this data analysis has made me more aware of the growth in the area of data science and the management of data. The skills that I imagined would be most in demand across the IT industry (based on the Kangaroo’s ideal job selection) were in line with my expectations. Having these data summarised has had the great benefit of highlighting the key focus areas of what skills (both hard and soft skills) are most in demand with employers. As a result, I will be tailoring my self-directed learning to focus more on the SQL and database knowledge, and I will make a concerted effort to improve both my written and verbal communication skills in preparation for entering the IT workforce. </p>"+
"<p>John: My career path has been built over 35+ years and i do not believe that an ideal job actually exists. Aligning what is valuable, generated from the research and what makes you happy are the driving factors i apply. The role CDO, is generally an extension of my current role but understanding market IT skill movements allows me to help my teams development and increases my career choices   </p>"+
"<p>Nicole: For the ideal job section of assignment one, I was unsure of what I would consider my ideal job. For this reason, I am remaining open minded and researching the current job outlook in Australia has been an interesting venture. I want to take time to further consider what my ideal job would be. During the remainder of my studies, I will be sure to keep in mind what areas I will benefit from and use the resources provided to make the most of my knowledge.</p>"+
"<p>Tarish: The stance towards and obtaining the necessary qualification for a security analyst role has not changed. The data suggest a significant uptick in the job growth for Database & Systems Administrators & ICT Security in the next 5 year. Furthermore, the industry currently has one of the lowest employment rates in the field of IT, making it a promising area for career development  </p>"+
"<p>Tatsuya: After reviewing the data analysis my opinion on my ideal job remains the same. However, the data analysis has given me insight on the future growth of software and applications programmers. The projected growth for software developers is promising with a job growth rate of 27% in the next five years. This is ideal for me as it's clear that my ideal job is currently in demand with the potential for future growth. </p>" +

"<p><a href='https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/Temp198/ETgYWyMcEdBNqCMixaHQHlsByqE1pD3HS52_E61S2DLK7g?e=iGOaQg'>SharePoint Interview Link</a> </p>"+

"<h2>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>" +
"<p>The IT professional interviewed was Robert O’Brien. He works across in an IT tech role at an audio-visual company and in his spare time works on maintaining a private game server with around 4500 subscribed users. </p>"+
"<p>Within his role in the AV industry, he does a lot of backend work, maintaining networks for a variety of venues/event spaces across Melbourne, managing and programming the automation of sound, vision and lighting systems through programs such as Q-Sys. Another prominent role of his is the setup and hosting of web streams for virtual events, as well as the subsequent management of the cloud-based servers used to store and transfer event-related files and recordings. </p>"+
"<p>In his other project, the gaming servers, he is a jack-of-all-trades, doing a little bit of everything to ensure the smooth running of this “24-hour operation”. From working on game updates, responding to customer queries, and responding to cyber-security threats. Across the two jobs, there is no such thing as a “normal” day. </p>"+

"<h2>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? </h2>" +
"<p>According to Rob he deals with a vast, diverse group of people on a daily basis. When discussing the AV industry he mentioned the obvious, the other members of the IT team and managements, there are the also the other coworkers who may be for example riggers or lighting techs, the venue staff who maintain the event spaces and their other associated contractors, the event talent (especially on the online events that he primarily oversees), and the clients may be anybody from high-end corporate events managers to wedding planners or the couple’s themselves. </p>"+
"<p>In regards to the game server, the main population (besides other team members) would be the players themselves. Most the other interactions being between himself and other IT professionals working in cyber-security and server management. This is because data collection and session hosting are handled on a private data centre (provided to cyber-security firms when needed) and the game server infrastructure is provided through Microsoft’s IaaS platform, Azure</p>"+

"<h2>How is most of the IT professional’s time spent? </h2>" +
"<p>In his AV role, Rob claims a significant portion of his time is spent trying to troubleshoot and solve co-worker’s problems over the phone. It’s something that is not really discussed much about the industry but whilst trying to keep on top of daily tasks and client requests he says he is often sapped of time by needing to help others out remotely. It can become such a burden that in a question about removing one responsibility from his roles, the over-the-phone tech support part was the thing he would gladly see go. </p>"+
"<p>Regarding the game server role, a majority of his time (when not overwhelmed by small bug fixes) is spent keeping up to date with the world of security, with a particular emphasis on the gaming industry and cheating. It is an ever-evolving threat that you can’t afford to fall victim to, especially as a small company. </p>"+

"<h2>What are the most challenging aspects of the IT professional's roles? </h2>" +
"<p>For both roles, the most challenging aspect is staying up to date with the newest technologies and threats. Work in the AV industry has its own set of challenges, adapting an installation to ensure it fits within a clients brief being chief among them. The true challenge here is not just staying within the budget but it is in trying to interpret what their vision is for the event, based off their limited technical perspective. From there, specifying the right equipment to get the job done becomes a whole lot simpler. </p>"+


"<h2>What are the skills that the IT professional thinks everyone entering the IT industry should have, where would they begin if they had to start over? </h2>" +
"<p>Rob said in his opinion, the soft skills around problem solving are what all people looking to enter the IT industry should look to pick up. Be it from programming to assessing security/data breaches, the ability to survey a problem from a broad perspective, discern where it is coming from, and take action to remedy it is invaluable. He used the example of programming where something as small as a simple syntax error in one line of code can create serious issues. </p>"+
"<p>His advice around what aspects of IT he would suggest people focus on first was simple, start with what you want to do. Follow the path that interests you the most as he believes there is little to gain from studying something you’re not invested in emotionally. Try the thing that piques your interest, from there, you will find out whether you like it and if it is worth pursuing. </p>"+

"<h2>In their opinion, what does the future look like for both the IT professional's field, and IT as a whole? </h2>" +
"<p>Rob gave a pretty broad answer to this question, saying that it is hard to see for certain where the IT industry is headed. The pace of change is so rapid and access to gigabit internet so freely available that the only thing that is certain is that hardware will continue to get more powerful and more affordable. IT is becoming ever more ubiquitous in our everyday lives, so who knows what the future may hold? </p>"+

"<h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</h2>" +
"<p>Integrated circuits, computer-based boards and peripherals were notoriously expensive and non-modular creating complex development environments and accessibility issues for the general population. The advent of modularised computer-based systems allowed reduced cost of manufacture and increased accessibility which in turn allowed increased development opportunities both in hardware and software. Raspberry Pis brought a small, modularised PC to the general public at low cost and using this methodology it allowed everyday users to develop products and applications without the complexity of commercial level development boards. It also allowed people from all over the world access to powerful low-cost computer-based technologies both for development and general use. Later, again due to the low-cost element and modularisation, it allowed educational entities the ability to teach students at any age, the fundamental elements of hardware and software development. Additional reading on the history of the Raspberry Pi is available on many web pages, however a short and concise text is 'The Epic Story of the Raspberry Pi' from https://raspberrytips.com/raspberry-pi-history/ (Fromaget 2022). </p>" +
"<p>Both raspberry Pi and adreno technologies, or more accurately, the manufacturers of these products have allowed the public access to development boards for product development. While this is a major step forward it also has issues because while these boards are cheap, commercial development into a consumer product would be considerably and preventatively expensive, most manufacturers would use the development board to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then scale the circuitry / hardware to make it commercially viable (Product Plan 2022). This is beyond the capabilities of a hobbyist or someone in the general population and requires teams who can navigate the legal requirements of product development but also ensuring that the product meets standards across multiple countries, an example of this, would be EMC and CE marking for regulatory compliance for a particular country. While the Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards have passed these tests it’s important that the tests include its intended environment as part of those compliance regulations (Proofpoint 2022). </p>"+
"<p>The advantages however, enabled by these development boards allow people within the general population at both a professional and hobbyist level to learn and experiment with new concepts and ideas. Without such technology would not be possible and would require sophisticated developers with bespoke development boards being created as they were in the past (Pi Day n.d.). </p>"+
"<p>Due to the reduced costs of PC manufacture and Integrated Circuits (IC’s) in general and the modulisation of communication protocols used generally (blue tooth, Wi-Fi etc) it is now possible to build hardware which can be thought of as “Lego” expanding or reducing the main board to accommodate your application. This lends itself to small modular IC’s which perform complex functions as part of the hardware configuration and provides less development requirements for each modular element, this has been mirrored with programming languages that support these technologies in general. Languages such as C++, Python also work on modular or containerised scripts and programmes that others have developed which you are able to use within your application through the open-source licensing agreements (Wikipedia 2022). </p>"+
"<p>These elements combined provide the general population with the ability to develop very complex applications at virtually no cost. The future of this modularised concept allows us access to newer technologies such as IoT, machine learning and artificial intelligence which can be incorporated into complex hardware such as robots or self-driving cars as an example (Pedamkar 2022). This increasing to provide us with plug and play technologies both in hardware and software allows not just one individual to develop applications or concepts but the entire population, it is not uncommon for groups of likeminded individuals from around the world contributing to a common application, this brining substantial innovation benefits. The future, generally, is more focused on the understanding of combining all these technologies rather than development of the technology itself. </p>"+
"<p>In the next 3 years the plug and play element or simplification of complex integrated circuits as part of expansion of the main Arduino or Raspberry Pi board will become more prevalent, and less understanding will be required of the under lying technologies to develop your application. Currently this technology does not need you to understand the inner working of a 12C Communications protocol, but more how to wire the hardware using breadboards and then control the data with programming because if it did you would need additional hardware, oscilloscopes, and such things. The software element is becoming more important to understand than the hardware itself, and due to the complexities of programming in the past, newer programming languages or higher-level languages are becoming dominant, Python being a good example of this, which is accessibly to anyone with a PC and is being taught at schools and education facilities all over the world today (McKeown 2019). </p>"+
"<p>It is unlikely that Raspberry Pi’s or Arduino boards will be used in a commercial setting due to the cost of development, however, the effects of the masses having access to this technology and it being taught it in education facilities is interesting because many of the commercially developed products on the market both in hardware and software are using the same pattern and this can be seen in the use of python for the development of IoT sensors on the market now, additionally python is also used in the development of modelling software and AI technologies. The ability of people to interact with commercial products via API’s is becoming a significant development across multiple industries, this in turn is driving further demand for adreno / raspberry pi technologies for people to learn and develop on (McKeown 2019). Technologies which are built on non-modularised and old development boards and programming languages that people don’t’ understand anymore will become obsolete and this newer technology will replace them. This is because generally, bespoke, or highly complex technologies which require support become very expensive when compared to a modularised system. This will make it commercially unviable for those older systems. </p>"+
"<p>The affects to me personally would be negligible because I do not produce products within my career, those that do, would also not be directly affected if they are following a similar pattern of development as discussed above. It does however open newer possibilities for engineers, hobbyists and people working within the IT industry to gain in-depth understanding of the technologies that these boards offer more fundamentally though, it allows significant access to innovation and creativity due to its broad spectrum of users. The affect to business could be that the business IT needs to enable its staff access to these technologies allowing development of supporting software that the business uses. This would allow them to communicate with business level technologies and commercially produced technologies such as IoT devices, this will be done via the Application Programming Interface (API) available across nearly every product that businesses use today. </p>"+
"<p>This technology brings programming and software development to a much younger audience. It will allow many children to have interactions with programming as entertainment which is something that was not available in the past. </p>"+

"<h2>Cyber security</h2>" +
"<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and devices from digital attacks, theft, and damage. It involves implementing measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems. As our reliance on technology has grown, it has become easier for cybercriminals to access sensitive information and disrupt critical systems. Cybersecurity measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and secure protocols are used to prevent unauthorised access to networks, devices, and data, to protect against viruses, malware, and other types of threats (Wario, G. 2022). Cybersecurity is important because it helps to prevent data breaches, identity theft, and other types of cyber-attacks that can have serious consequences for individuals, businesses, and governments. This field is constantly evolving, so it is important to stay up to date with the latest best practices and technologies to keep systems and data secure. </p>"+
"<p>As almost everything digitalised now significant steps need to be taken to improve the security of data, PII and other sensitive information that is stored on digital hardware. There are several ways to improve cybersecurity in all industries. Implementing strong, unique passwords and regularly updating them is one effective way to protect against unauthorised access. Adding an extra layer of security through two-factor authentication also known as multifactor authentication (MFA) can also help. MFA involves the use of at least two different authentication components, such as something you know (e.g. a password), something you have (e.g. a security token or a smartphone), or something you are (e.g. a fingerprint or facial recognition). It is important to keep software and systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates to prevent vulnerabilities within your organisation from being exploited. Training employees on cybersecurity best practices and using encryption for sensitive data can also help reduce the risk of an attack. Regular security assessments and having a response plan to cybersecurity incidents can also help mitigate the damage and minimise the impact of an attack. It's important for organisations to take a proactive approach to cybersecurity, rather than waiting until an attack occurs before acting (Touro College 2021). By staying vigilant and taking steps to prevent attacks, organisations or individuals can better protect themselves and their customers from cyber threats . </p>"+
"<p>There are several technologies currently used in the cybersecurity industry to protect against cyber threats. The most used software-based technology that can be highlighted is the Anti-virus and anti-malware software that are designed to detect and remove malware, such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, from computers and devices. Firewalls are network security systems that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules and are utilised by almost all corporation from big to small. Another significant tech used in the industry is the Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) that help monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and block or alert on any suspicious activity. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into coded text that can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key. Identity and access management (IAM) systems are designed to manage and protect the identities of users and devices within an organisation, including managing login credentials and controlling access to resources based on user permissions. Network segmentation the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller sub-networks, or segments, in order to limit the spread of a cyber threat. A technology I utilise daily is a Virtual private network (VPNs) this is used to create a secure, encrypted connection between a device and a network, allowing users to access the network securely over the internet. Security information and event management (SIEM) systems collect and analyse security-related data from multiple sources in order to identify and respond to potential cyber threats (Kaspersky 2022). This technology Is particularly useful for large cooperations with a complex network and provides a more centralised platform in order respond to security events and alerts. Finally, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can be used to analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns that may indicate a cyber threat, allowing organisations to take proactive measures to prevent attacks. To sum it up, there are lots of different technologies out there that people and companies can use. Even though these technologies are advanced, they must keep changing and improving to keep up with new threats that are always emerging. </p>"+
"<p>In the future, we can expect to see the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify and prevent cyber threats in real-time. There will also be a greater focus on securing data and applications in the cloud as the use of cloud computing grows. To protect against the potential threat of quantum computers breaking current encryption methods, there will likely be a greater focus on developing and adopting quantum-resistant technologies. Traditional authentication methods such as passwords are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks, so we may see a greater focus on using biometric authentication methods like fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans to provide an additional layer of security. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it is important for individuals and organisations to stay up-to-date on the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices, so there may be a greater emphasis on cybersecurity education and training to help individuals and organisations stay informed and protect against cyber threats. </p>"+
"<p>Cybersecurity impacts the average person in multiple ways. It is important for protecting personal information (PII) and financial information from being accessed or stolen by unauthorised bad actors. If an individual's personal information is accessed or stolen, it can be used for identity theft, which can have serious consequences including financial losses and damage to an individual. Cybersecurity is also important for protecting against fraudulent activities such as phishing scams, which can trick individuals into revealing personal information or installing malware on their devices. If an individual's accounts are hacked, they may lose access to these accounts and the information and resources associated with them. Cybersecurity is also important for protecting an individual's privacy, as it helps prevent unauthorised access to personal information or data. To protect ourselves from these risks, it is important for us to be aware of cybersecurity risks and take steps to protect themselves, such as using strong and unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping software and devices up to date. On a personal level I’m a big advocate on the former practices and urge all my friends and family to follow suit. </p>"+

"<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>" +
"<p>An autonomous vehicle or AV for short is an automobile that utilizes its environmental senses to operate fully independent without the use of human intervention. AV’s allow passengers to freely travel to a destination as a conventional car would but without the oversight of a driver. According to the “The Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders” (SMMT) autonomous vehicles are categorised into five distinct levels (SMMT 2020). The following levels can be seen below. </p>" +
"<p>Level 0 - No Automation (Manual control) </p>" +
"<p>Level 1 - Driver Assistance (Single automated system) </p>" +
"<p>Level 2 - Partial Automation (Advanced driver assistance system) </p>" +
"<p>Level 3 - Conditional Automation (Environmental detection capabilities) </p>" +
"<p>Level 4 - High Automation (Full automation under specific conditions) </p>" +
"<p>Level 5 - Full Automation (Full automation in any conditions) </p>" +
"<p>While AV’s offer convenience to the driver it also provides numerous benefits to society. One of the main advantages AVs create is the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which has evidently become an issue due to the explosion of automobile ownership. As of 2022 according to Our World in Data 45.1% of C02 emissions contribute to the global C02 emissions from transport (Our World Data 2020). Furthermore, AV’s have the potential to drastically improve transportation safety as well as greatly improving transportation logistics.   </p>" +
"<p>As of today, in 2023 the current AVs in use today range from levels zero to two with the majority of new manufactured cars being level 1 with features such as cruise control or basic steering control. Despite the rapid advancement in technology, car manufactures are still unable to overcome the technological hurdles to reach a fully autonomous vehicle which would range from level four to five. Companies such as Tesla have achieved to produce a level 2 AV with its two primary features being Tesla’s autopilot and full self-driving. Similar companies have also achieved autonomy level 2 such as GM’s super Cruise and Nissan’s ProPilot (Day.L 2021). However, due to the introduction of AV’s being relatively new to the consumer market companies such as Tesla have faced some backlash from the public. As Tesla’s autopilot still requires the driver to be fully aware of its surroundings in an event of a hazard however, due to negligence of the driver several accidents have occurred during its use.    </p>" +
"<p>An Autonomous car functions under five key individual process being computer vision, sensor fusion, localization, path planning, and control. When in operation the car will constantly scan for information and gather data to compile all the information together into one overall image using the sensor fusion. This is how AVs fundamentally operate as it’s constantly localizing the cars position to deduce the best optimal path/decision given in any particular circumstances.   </p>" +
"<p>Computer vision allows the car to use multiple sensors to observe the surrounding environment with the use of cameras, radars, and LiDARs. Like humans we have relied on our eyes to compile visual information. The same concept applies for the cameras as it allows the computer to detect and identify physical elements on the roads and surrounding environments. These may include but not limited to road lines, traffic lights, car, etc. However, unlike eyes cameras are unable to measure depth which subsequently leads to the use of radars and LiDARs. Radar allows the computer vision to measure the distance of an object with the use of emitted radio waves while LiDAR uses lasers to measure the depth of each object called a cloud point (Dholakia.S 2019).   </p>" +
"<p>As mentioned above sensor fusion complies all the data obtained from the computer vision (Visual information, radar, LiDAR) to create a reliable and accurate depiction of the surrounding area. This is essential for the operation of the car as sensor fusion can monitor the surrounding environment in real time intern allowing the AV to determine its speed and surroundings to make accurate decisions in real time. The AV will perform this iteration multiple times a second for improved accuracy and reliability. In conjunction to computer vision, AVs utilizes the use of localization to provide an extremely accurate position of the car. This is achieved by compiling the data measurements (e.g. distance) and GPS coordinates to triangulate the exact position of the vehicle on a macro and micro level (Dholakia.S 2019).</p>" +
"<p>With the use of computer vision and localization, the car will then begin its path planning and decision making to determine the saftest, practical, and most convenient route from point A to B. Path planning can be broken down into two key elements being behaviour prediction of mobile objects and behaviour planning. Using the computer vision with the help of multiple model algorithms the AV can predict the behaviour of surrounding environment to determine the most likely trajectory of a manoeuvrable object. The algorithms simultaneously predict each objects trajectory to allow the car to compute the probability of each object to which it determines the best possible action. While behaviour planning balances the efficiency, safety, and comfort to reach its destination in a suitable manner (Ryabchuk.P 2018).  </p>" +
"<p>Finally, control allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake to reach its destination using the data and trajectory of the path planner. Once the path planning has determined the cars trajectory it will send instructions to the electronic control unit (ECU) for the AV to execute.  </p>" +
"<p>As mentioned above majority of new cars on the road today are level 1 with a few companies producing level 2 AVs onto the market such as Tesla. However, companies such as Honda and Mercedes have introduced level 3 AVs to the market however, only under certain conditions being the highway. While on the highway Honda’s Sensing Elite and Mercedes Drive Pilot does not require the driver to pay attention.  The future of AVs is promising as companies such as Waymo are currently undergoing development of a level 4 AV aiming to remove the need for driver hand offs. As of now Waymo have introduced a small amount of driverless robotaxi service under trial for testing (Dholakia.S 2019). Furthermore, many truck companies are pushing for fully autonomous trucks due to the shortage of truck drivers. </p>" +
"<p>At the current rate of advancement in technology we would expect many AVs to popularise our roads very soon into the near future. If AVs populated our roads the impact it will create would increase road safety, transportation logistics and provide industrial/economic benefits. However, the introduction of AV’s will impact many jobs around the world making many jobs redundant while also creating many new jobs. According to the Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders (SMMT) by 2030 the AV industry will add 51 billion a year to the UK economy as well as creating an additional 320 000 jobs (SMMT 2020). Due to AV’s increasing safety on our roads its most likely cars that are level 0 and 1 will begin to transition into modern level 2 to 4 AV’s. This will also make combustion vehicles redundant due to the extensive advantages AVs provide. Furthermore, a drastic change in infrastructure will commence as AV’s heavily relies on GPS requiring a minimum of 4G to operate. Most countries around the world do not currently have the required infrastructure needed to fully implement AVs into society.  </p>" +
"<p>Autonomous vehicles would have a drastic impact on myself due to the convenience AVs provide. It would change my routine and improve time management allowing me to become more flexible. AV’s will improve safety not only for myself but for other individuals. For example, social events that includes the consumption of alcohol would allow people to travel home safely and reliably. More importantly AV’s will allow people who are disadvantaged (elderly, disabilities, etc) to travel freely without the help of another individual allowing for disadvantaged people to be more independent. Overall, autonomous vehicles would significantly improve quality of life and convenience to myself and friends/family.  </p>" +

"<h2>Machine Learning</h2>" +
"<p>Machine learning is a rapidly developing field that has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives. It is a method of teaching computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed, allowing them to identify patterns and make predictions based on data. This has a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and predictive modelling (Foy 2022). In recent years, the state of the art in machine learning has advanced significantly, with the development of deep learning techniques leading to significant improvements in various tasks. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as the need for large amounts of labelled training data and the development of algorithms that can effectively generalize to new, unseen data. Despite these challenges, the future of machine learning looks bright, with many exciting developments that are emerging. </p>"+
"<p>The future of machine learning is an exciting and rapidly evolving field, with many potential applications and developments on the horizon. Some of the key areas that are expected to see significant growth in the coming years include deep learning, natural language processing, the Internet of Things, and autonomous systems. Deep learning, which involves the training of artificial neural networks on large datasets, has already led to significant advancements in areas such as image and speech recognition. It is expected to continue to play a major role in the development of machine learning in the future. Natural language processing, which involves the ability of computers to understand and generate human-like language, is another area of active research in machine learning. In the future, it is expected that natural language processing will play a greater role in customer service, language translation, and language-based search. The Internet of Things (IoT), which refers to the growing network of devices that are connected to the internet, is another area where machine learning is expected to have a significant impact (Foote 2017). Machine learning algorithms will be used to analyse data collected by these devices, enabling a wide range of new applications and services. Finally, machine learning is also expected to play a key role in the development of autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and robots. These systems will rely on machine learning algorithms to make decisions and navigate their environments. Overall, the future of machine learning looks bright, and it is expected to have a significant impact on many aspects of our lives in the coming years. </p>"+
"<p>The potential impact of the developments in machine learning is significant and extensive. Machine learning has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives, including how we work, how we communicate, and how we access information. Some of the potential impacts of these developments include the following. Improved decision-making, machine learning algorithms can analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns that may be difficult for humans to understand. This can help organisations make more informed decisions, such as by predicting customer behaviour or identifying fraudulent activity. Enhanced productivity, machine learning can automate many tasks that are currently done manually, freeing up time for humans to focus on higher-level tasks. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Improved healthcare, machine learning can be used to analyse medical data and identify patterns that may be useful for diagnosis and treatment (Arshad 2022). It can also be used to predict patient outcomes and identify potential health issues before they become serious. Overall, the potential impact of machine learning is significant and wide-ranging. It has the potential to transform many aspects of our lives, and it will be interesting to see how it is used in the coming years to solve a wide range of problems and improve our daily lives. </p>"+
"<p>The impact of machine learning on jobs and technologies is a complex and multifaceted issue. On the one hand, machine learning has the potential to automate certain tasks that are currently done by humans, which could lead to job displacement. However, it also has the potential to create new job opportunities, such as for data scientists and machine learning engineers. In terms of technologies, machine learning has the potential to replace certain existing technologies or augment them in ways that make them more efficient or effective. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to analyse and interpret data in real-time, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making. This could lead to the replacement of certain existing technologies that are currently used for these tasks. Overall, it is difficult to predict exactly how machine learning will impact the job market and the use of certain technologies. It is likely that it will have both disruptive and transformative effects, and it will be important for individuals and organisations to adapt and stay up to date with these developments. It is also important to consider the ethical implications of these changes and ensure that they are implemented in a responsible and fair manner. </p>"+
"<p>Machine learning has the potential to transform many aspects of our daily lives and the lives of our families. It can be used to improve healthcare outcomes, enhance customer service, automate tasks, and improve decision-making. These changes are likely to lead to increased productivity and efficiency, as well as a higher quality of life for individuals and their families. While there may be some disruptions as machine learning is adopted and integrated into various industries and sectors, the overall impact is expected to be positive and transformative. </p>"+

"<h2>The Courtesy Light</h2>" +

"<hr>"+

"<h4>Overview</h4>" +
"<p>This project idea is about a theoretical design called The Courtesy Light. The Courtesy Light is a small, simple, and sleek LED that displays “Thanks” or “Sorry” when activated by a simple press of a button mounted somewhere convenient in the driver’s seat compartment. The Courtesy Light will also include customisation via a Bluetooth-connected app. The below report will discuss in detail the individual aspects of the design, features, and software. In addition, the report will evaluate the feasibility and skills required to make the Courtesy Light a reality. Furthermore, the report will outline the impacts that the Courtesy Light would create if it were to be introduced to and adopted by the general public.   </p>" +
"<hr>"+
"<h4>Motivation</h4>" +
"<p>A road rage survey conducted by insurance company Budget Direct in 2021 found that 45% of Australians have admitted to showing signs of road rage and 75% of Australians claim to have been a victim of road rage (Budget Direct 2021). Whether we like it or not, almost every vehicle owner has at least in some way been the subject of road rage. However, occasionally someone will show some courtesy on the road, whether that be letting someone in, giving way or letting someone know that they left something on top of their car. Regardless of the situation, we all get a sense of appreciation and think to ourselves I wish I could at least say ‘’Thanks/Sorry” to brighten up the fellow commuter’s day. In modern society, the use of cars has drastically expanded our capacity to travel. This is evident as according to Kemp (2022) in an article published by PD, there are currently 1.446 billion cars on the road as of 2022.  Therefore, this provides a vast extensive market for the use of a small LED that displays “Thanks”, “Sorry”, or other simple message(s) programmed via Bluetooth/app control, when activated by a simple press of a button. </p>" +
"<p>The automotive industry has seen an increase in the development and integration of third-party technology and features in vehicles. The trend seems to be towards more integration of third-party technology and features in the automotive industry, driven by consumer demand for advanced technology in vehicles.  </p>"+
"<p>In addition to conveying appreciation to amiable drivers, this system could be used as an additional safety feature (especially if taken up by manufacturers). If acceleration or deceleration exceed certain rates, the LED panels of the Courtesy Light could be triggered automatically. Brooks, in a study of acceleration rates in rural Pennsylvania, found that on average, a car accelerating to 40kph did so at a rate of 3.10 km/h/s and a car accelerating to 60kmph did so at a rate of 3.90 km/h/s (Brooks 2012). The average urban speed limits in Victoria fit within this range (VicRoads 2021), thus if a car was determined to be accelerating at a rate greater than say 5.00km/h/s (an optimal speed could be determined with more accuracy via further testing) then the Courtesy light could be turned on to make other drivers aware of this ‘reckless’ driving. One further benefit of this is that it draws attention to risky driving behaviours for any law enforcement officers in the area.  </p>"+

"<hr>"+

"<h4>Description</h4>" +
"<h5>User Interface </h5>"+
"<p>As alluded to above, the LED “Thanks/Sorry” display product will be called the Courtesy Light. The Courtesy Light’s two main features are an LED display, consisting of a series of 8x8 LED modules. These will have predefined buttons for displaying “Sorry” and “Thanks” to other drivers controlled by the other primary feature of the Courtesy Light, the button interface. There will be two buttons for the standard messages (one for displaying ”Sorry” and the other for displaying “Thanks” with the option to add extra buttons for up to 2 additional customised messages programmed via the accompanying app. The fundamental design idea of the Courtesy Light is to keep the physical user interface as simple as possible. This is because it is important not to overwhelm the driver with excessive features and buttons that could lead to a potential safety hazard as it may be more of a distraction than a tool.      </p>"+


"<h5>Compatibility </h5>"+
"<p>Even though there are 1.446 billion cars on the roads today (Kemp 2022), the make and model of these cars spans over 50+ years of products. Therefore, it is important that The Courtesy Light has a universal installation method to, providing the ability for use in any automobile, regardless of the age or vehicle type. Additionally, if the Courtesy Light were only compatible with a small subset of models, this would drastically reduce the consumer market of the product. A cheap and simple solution for this is the use of Velcro. The advantages of Velcro are it is cheap, versatile, resistant to degradation by sunlight, its adhesive strength does not change when wet, and it has the ability to hold significant amounts of weight (Sage-Advices 2020). All these advantages are very beneficial for the intended application here with the Courtesy Light. The buttons will be mounted with the use of Velcro for easy and simple setup with the intention of user friendliness. The use of Velcro will allow the user to personalise where the buttons will be set to best suit their vehicle, personal preferences, and body type. Like the buttons, the LED display will also use Velcro for the installation against the rear window of the car.    </p>"+


"<h5>Design </h5>"+
"<p>Colour and design play an important role in creating a product that is attractive, functional, and distinguishable. A well-designed product can make it easier to use and understand, creating a wider appeal and attracting more potential customers. When creating a device for automotive vehicle safety is also a big consideration in the design process. This is because it can have a direct impact on the safety of the vehicle's occupants and other road users. The Courtesy Light will be designed with human factors in mind, to minimise driver distraction and ensure the safety of the occupants of the car and other road users. Compliance is also an important consideration for the design of The Courtesy Light. It will comply with any relevant regulations and standards for automotive devices, including safety, and cybersecurity standards.  </p>"+
"<p>The colour of the LED will be green. The primary reason for this is that according to ColorPsychology.org, green has long been associated with feelings of calm, tranquillity, balance and optimism (P 2016). In addition, green was chosen as it will not interfere with the existing lights on the vehicle. If the display were to be orange or red, it may be mistaken for a turn signal or brake lights which would in turn lead to a safety hazard to other drivers.  When the display is activated, the display will be a static light. If the display were to have flashing lights or animations, it could present more of a distraction rather than a message. For this reason, once the button is pressed the message will only display for a short period of time (between 2 and 10 seconds, duration preferences would be selectable in the app), allowing the other driver to recognise the message without impeding their focus.   </p>"+


"<h5>Partner Application </h5>"+
"<p>The Courtesy Light will also include personal customisation through the use of an application. The app will be available on iOS and Android compatible devices and downloadable via the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This app will allow the user to pair their Courtesy Light device to the app using Bluetooth. This app would include language option support for a variety of common languages, the ability to create your own customisable display messages, alter the duration for which a message is displayed, alter the brightness level and more (potential for a forum system for sharing people’s custom creations for example). The language options will expand the consumer market and availability across the globe. With the addition of the downloadable app, it allows for the product to be user-friendly while also offering ease of access enhancing the overall user experience.  </p>"+
"<p>The aim for The Courtesy Light app will be to enhance the features already present in the Courtesy Light device. For this reason, it is important that the app is simple and easy to use for the wide target market of The Courtesy Light. The design of the app will be user-centred and will use Nielsen’s Heuristics as a guideline for the user interface. Nielsen's heuristics focus on simplicity and usability, which are key factors in designing a basic app (Nielsen 1994). By following these guidelines, developers can create an app that is easy to use, even for those with limited technical skills. If an app is difficult to use, users may be less likely to adopt it and continue using it. By making the app easy to use, developers can increase the likelihood that users will adopt and continue using the app.  </p>"+
"<p>The customisation options will need to be limited to prevent misuse of The Courtesy Light. It is important that The Courtesy Light Device remain a courtesy and does not become a tool to cause further road rage. Having a guideline and a code of conduct for communication will serve as a reference for what is considered offensive and what is not.   </p>"+
"<p>Security concerns are also an important consideration when creating a customisable Bluetooth-compatible device. Apple and Android devices provide security support for Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It is important for the app to maintain compliance with the industry standards and it will require updates as the standards change overtime. If the security standards are not met, the app will be vulnerable to third party attacks (Marks 2023).   </p>"+
"<p>Maintenance and update compatibility are important factors to consider when creating an app. Maintenance is important for any application because it ensures that the app remains secure, stable, efficient, and relevant for its users. User feedback is an important part of the creation of any application as it provides developers with a 2-way communication channel with their user base. It is an important tool for ensuring that The Courtesy Light app is meeting the needs of its users and for making data-driven decisions about how to improve it. User feedback will be collected within the app and updates will be centred around what the feedback has told the development team. The type of feedback users will be able to provide from within the app will include reporting any errors that they have encountered and any recommendations they may have (Singh 2020). The user feedback feature will also follow Nielsen's heuristics guidelines and be simple and easy to use. Using Nielsen's heuristics will help ensure that user feedback is collected in a consistent and structured way, making it easier to identify patterns and trends in the feedback. This can help the developers know what to prioritise and which issues should be addressed first. It will also provide more detailed information on how users are interacting with the product.  </p>"+


"<h5>Future Plans and Further Considerations  </h5>"+
"<p>One major drawback of the Courtesy Light is that the language options will only include common languages. While common languages will be available there are still many opportunities to expand beyond these initial few. A solution to this would be to provide updates for the app to incorporate other languages into the display as the demand and development support for these languages progresses.   </p>"+
"<p>Should manufacturers take the idea of the Courtesy Light on, it could have speedometer information fed to it via the car’s main system or alternatively, a small accelerometer could be used in place of this speedometer data (in older models of car for example). This would allow for the Arduino Uno device powering the Courtesy Light (see image below in Tools and Technologies) to calculate the car’s acceleration rate of change. If this rate was 5.00km/h/s or beyond, as mentioned in the above Motivation section, any acceleration determined to be in excess of this rate would cause the Courtesy Light to turn on all LEDs in the display for a duration of 3 seconds. This would provide obvious feedback to other nearby drivers of potentially hazardous driving and/or conditions nearby, and automatically provide a signal of apology to nearby drivers at the same time.  </p>"+
"<p>The Courtesy Light will initially be released to a smaller market. Releasing to a smaller market is beneficial because it allows for a lower-risk introduction, valuable feedback, cost-effectiveness, testing, market research, branding, and marketing strategies. It can also help identify and overcome any issues that may arise when scaling to a larger market. Future expansion will be dependent on the success of initial release (Carter 2022).   </p>"+

"<hr>"+

"<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>" +
"<p>The aim of the Courtesy Light product was to keep the design as simple as possible, for this will allow for easy and cheap manufacturing. The image shown below is a basic circuit diagram of the Courtesy Light (not including potential accelerometer additions). </p>" +
"<img src='./CircuitDiagram.png' alt='CircuitDiagram' id='img_fullsize'></img>"+
"<p>This circuit demonstrates how the Courtesy light will operate and how the individual components and hardware are connected. The hardware needed for the RGB light is a Arduino Uno – R3, generic breadboard, 12V battery holder, LED matrix, resistors, push button, capacitor, voltage regulator, Bluetooth serial module and jumper wires. All the components listed can be seen in the labelled circuit diagram. With all these components a basic version of the Courtesy light can be created. The versatility of the Arduino Uno is that the software/code written to run the device can be written and edited rather simply using a variety of languages and plugins/overlays to the Arduino IDE (explored further in the following section). </p>" +
"<p>The Courtesy Light app will use Bluetooth API (Application Programming Interface) through iOS and Android. This API will allow the app to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices, connect to them, and send and receive data. This will connect through the Bluetooth serial module as shown on the above diagram. From this, the user can use the Bluetooth API to send commands to the device (Park n.d.).  </p>"+
"<p>The partner app will be created as a native app on iOS and Android. Creating a native app  allows for a more seamless and optimised user experience on those specific platforms. Additionally, native apps can be distributed through the respective app stores, having met the compliance guidelines and regulations. Android and iOS apps are typically developed using different programming languages and development environments (IDEs) (Trogrlic 2022). Bluetooth API compatibility exists within both of these device’s development programs, although compliance is dependent on the respective app stores and will be met where is appropriate.  </p>"+
"<p>For the Android app, the programming language used will be Java. This is one of the most commonly used languages for Android apps and will work well for the features required in the Courtesy Light app. Android Studio is the most popular IDE for Android app development and it will be used to develop the Courtesy Light app. It is based on IntelliJ IDEA and provides a wide range of tools for building, testing, and debugging Android apps (Harvey 2021).  </p>"+
"<p>For the iOS app, the app will use the programming language Swift, which is the most commonly used programming language for iOS apps. Xcode is the most popular IDE for iOS app development and it will be used to develop the Courtesy Light app. It is a suite of tools developed by Apple for building, testing, and debugging iOS apps (Patel 2022).  </p>"+

"<h4>Skills Required</h4>" +
"<p>The hardware skills required for the project would be to at least have a basic knowledge of electronics and circuit design. The ‘brains’ of the project will be an Arduino Uno, which requires basic knowledge of hardware to understand how they operate and may be instructed to function. In order to power and coordinate the design of how the electrical signals will be sent throughout the circuit, a strong foundation in circuit design would be ideal (especially if further revisions are required later on in the design process). Basic fundamentals in programming and software design will also be required (Soderby, 2022). </p>" +
"<p>For these skills, there are a myriad of helpful resources available online (both paid and free) as well as through formal educational institutions (Universities or TAFE). Some free resources include - Programming Electronics Academy’s “Arduino MASTERCLASS” video on YouTube (Arduino MASTERCLASS | Full Programming Workshop in 90 Minutes!), or the Arduino Learn documentation available on their website (https://docs.arduino.cc/learn). If a more structured approach is required for certain individuals or aspects of Arduino programming and implementation, there are the paid courses such as the many available on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/topic/arduino/) or for more foundational knowledge, there is the university path. Subjects like Introduction to Programming at RMIT (https://www.open.edu.au/subjects/rmit-university-introduction-to-programming-rmi-cpt120) or Electrical and Electronic System via USA (https://www.open.edu.au/subjects/university-of-south-australia-electrical-and-electronic-systems-usa-eeet1029) via Open Universities Australia provide a great foundation from which to ground the supplementary information available freely on the internet.  </p>"+

"<h4>Outcome</h4>" +
"<p>If this project were successful many people around the world would have installed The Courtesy Light into their cars, or better yet, manufacturers would be designing their cars with implementation and integration of the Courtesy Light in mind. Furthermore, if the project were successful many drivers around the world would have theoretically diffused many road rage situations. By just showing a little courtesy on the roads every day around the world it would lead to a much healthier and safer environment on public roads. According to an article by Robert Munoz on road rage statistics from the United States, aggressive driving is a factor in around 56% of accidents, with road rage related deaths in the past 10 years reaching a total over 5 times the amount from the previous 10 years (Muñoz, 2023). In response to these shocking numbers, a product like the Courtesy Light could make some impact in halting the upward trend in road rage incidences. Any road rage instance that is de-escalated is a victory and well worth the investment and development time of a device such as this. We in the Kangaroos group believe that due to the ubiquity of car usage especially in the western world, that we have become complacent in the dangers that they can pose. Vehicles weighing over 1,000kgs travelling at 60km/h have the potential to cause life changing injury or death to those involved in accidents. A snap judgement, or imagined slight is all that it can take sometimes for a situation to spiral out of control. Sometimes all that is necessary to prevent things getting out of hand is a simple apology. With widespread adoption, we are sure that the Courtesy Light would have a positive impact on the overall number of automotive accidents caused by road rage worldwide. </p>" +

"<h2>John Gude</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>As a group of people with varying backgrounds who had never met before, we came together and collaborated very well to complete the assignment within the scheduled deadlines. Our organisation and time management were our strengths.</p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>Decision making on what the project would be could have been improved and decisions made earlier in the process. However, the feasibility of the project was an early concern to the group and made deciding on the project more complex. The group used a voting system to get the consensus based on 3 concept ideas. It was decided through that medium that simplicity would be advantageous to us in the later stages should the concept idea need building.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>That the team didn’t require direct leadership. We all contributed effectively and were proactive on taking action to complete tasks that need doing rather than having someone assign tasks to them. This team was built on initiative and collective benefit which is unusual within a new group of people.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>People often play down or are not confident about their skills or what they can offer in group situations.</p>"+
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>The team used MS Teams as their primary communication platform. Weekly meetings were set up  along with meeting agenda and minutes, however MS teams chats was used as required during the week for general conversations and updates. Git updates messages were reflective of the updates by the team and were easy to understand and track. However, due to the configuration of the webpage, most updates were text based for the assignment sections rather than coding level updates. Access to Git and GitHub and teams was provided to all members while recordings etc were located on SharePoint, MS Teams repository. Alignment of GitHub updates and tasks allocated to team members during meetings mirrored very closely</p>" +

"<hr>"+

"<h2>Nicole Brooker</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>For this assignment, our group planned well ahead of when the assignment was due. This gave us plenty of time later on to organise and coordinate when we were working on more complicated parts of this assignment. The group has been able to effectively communicate through Microsoft Teams and everyone has been active and participated. </p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>While the group planned ahead, we took a decent amount of time to decide on a team project idea. This was largely due to discussion around what assignment 3 would require of our group and how everyone's interests and skill sets could be best utilised.   </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>Our group was able to work well despite obstacles faced. For example, we had a member leave within the first couple of weeks and the work that had been allocated to them was swiftly undertaken by another group member. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>One thing that I have learned about groups is the benefit of group work when people are engaged. Group members brought different perspectives through their work, which I think was a great benefit to our final assignment.   </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>Our group’s GitHub log is not necessarily a reflection on how our group worked for this assignment. This is due to our group making commits for small and large sections of this assignment and general troubleshooting taking up a generous number of commits.    </p>" +

"<hr>"+

"<h2>Benjamin Turner</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the kangaroos team early on decided to divide up the tasks between members based on our skillsets and interest areas. This proved to be a good decision as it minimised friction between team members in terms of our contributions and ensured we all had a set of tasks to perform.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>I think initially we were a bit reserved in terms of communication in Microsoft Teams and the meetings, but this got better once we began to get to know each other. We were also a bit hesitant in making group decisions regarding the project topic.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>I was honestly surprised at how open everyone was to help if other team members were having issues. I have worked in teams before where there was an expectation that we all made our contributions, but it was the burden of one or two to pick up the slack (nominated as editors or scribes for example), but here things have been very smooth with everyone working to their strengths.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learnt the value of open discussion regarding updating team other team members on progress of our sections. It ensures all team members are on the same page or can make adjustments to the workload if need be. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the GitHub activity log does not necessarily accurate trace of amount of work done by team members overall but it does show that we were all participating. Whether individuals decided to add their contributions in large batches, in a series of small commits, or had others upload their sections, the logs can make it seem like some team members did significantly more work than the others which is not the case.</p>" +
"<p>That said the group meeting discussion and meeting minutes documents are a closer reflection to how the work was divided amongst team members. We were quite active in the message forums within Microsoft Teams as well as regularly uploading our work into a shared template document and later a shared document for submission.</p>" +
"<hr>"+

"<h2>Tarish Kapur</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p> The team was able to come together effectively and establish clear goals and objectives for the assignment. Through effective communication among team members, they were able to understand the tasks assigned to them after the first meeting.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team performed exceptionally well and there were no major issues to be addressed. However, one suggestion for improvement would be in the decision-making process when selecting the group project. Initially, there was some uncertainty among the team, but they ultimately decided to use a voting poll to make the final decision. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>The team's organisation was a surprise to me. From the setup of GitHub pages to the structured meeting agendas, and the proactive attitude of each team member in completing assigned tasks. Additionally, the team's technical knowledge, particularly in coding and setting up GitHub pages was instrumental in the successful setup of the website. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>Clear communication and organisation are vital components for the success of any group. They can determine the effectiveness of the group's performance. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p> The team found the GitHub log to be user-friendly, and several members were proficient in its use. This made it easy to resolve any issues that arose during the assignment. </p>" +

"<h2>Tatsuya Rood'e</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p> I believe that our team “Kangaroos” is well organized and structured to accomplish our end goal as a team. The team has organized meetings, scheduled every week to allow us to assign and discuss certain topics about our assignment.  We have assigned roles that best suit to everyone’s strengths and weaknesses to efficiently contribute to our assignment.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team as a whole is dedicated and well organised with little room for improvement however, an area that I could have improved on would be my website development skills so I could have contributed more towards the development of the website. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>One thing that surprised me was the diversity of our group members and how we were able to work coherently as a team to accomplish our end goal. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learned that when working as a team we are able to overcome any challenges when we help and learn from each other as a team. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>It is evident that the whole team is contributing towards our assignment as we have a record of our teams Github log. By observing the activity log on Github we can see all members of the team have contributed within a week. This reassures that our team is working together to accomplish our end goal.   </p>" +
"<hr>"+

"<h2>Group Reflection </h2>"+
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>The team was able to allocate tasks for the assignment outputs based on early decisions to read each other's profiles created as part of assignment 1. This allowed us to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses and form an understanding of how to approach the assignment tasks as a team .The teams early agreement to use MS Teams as a standard communication medium, combined with regular meetings that were scheduled, the team was able to rely on each and every team member to support each other for general issues, understanding during the week. Due to the planning element of the teams, using meeting agendas, minutes and scheduled meetings, it allowed the team to produce a quality report and web page which employed all the teams input and skills.  </p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team worked exceptionally well together based on the limited time we had to come together as a group. The key improvement area we identified was decision making, with particular reference to the project idea. The team deferred the idea to later in the production of the assignment outputs, while this allowed the team to move forward on production of the document and webpages, it was also something that was of concern. The team rectified this by using a voting system, however it wasn't so much that the team members disagreed with ideas but more that the next assignment is linked to this idea and this caused us to re-think because of the lack of clarity. Despite this the team moved forward and chose an idea and shows how well the team have come together.  </p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>The surprising element to the team revolved around the diversity and efficiency of the group to work together as a group. The team members quickly came to the understanding that each one of us was able to offer skills and support to each other despite differing levels of skill against a specific area. Everyone had something that another team member needed and each member was willing and able to help.   </p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>The team learned more than anything both as a group and individually that groups require cooperation and understanding that each member is important. To be successful all team member need to be engaged and pro-active. This means to support each team member when needed and to contribute in multiple ways, advice, technical, emotionally or just being there to ask a question in some way. Much of our interactions were via messages so it really doesn't matter how the interactions in the group happen but that they do.  </p>"+
