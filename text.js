"<p>After reviewing the results its concluded that all three tests were relatively accurate towards my personality and work style. While the tests were true in some parts, it was inaccurate in other areas. The results of the Myers Brig test shows that I am an Advocate (INFJ-T). According to Myers-Briggs an advocate’s strengths are creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and altruistic. Through self-evaluation an advocate’s strengths do match my strengths. An advocate’s weaknesses are sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary, and prone to burnout. One aspect of the results I disagree with in the Myer-Briggs test is that advocates are perfectionistic. While I do believe its important to put in one hundred percent effort into my work, I do realize that we do not live in a perfect world and not everything can be perfect.</p>"+

"<p>Across the Kangaroos 5 members there are 4 distinct disciplines or career paths mentioned. John seeking to enter a more managerial role as a Chief digital officer, Tatsuya looking to enter industry as a software developer, Tarish is after a position in cyber security and both Nicole and Ben’s ideal roles are similar within the field of data science (Nicole’s leaning towards data analysis, Ben’s towards data management). </p>"+
"<p>All besides John’s CDO role (needing 20+ years' experience) require between 2-5 years of experience which is an accurate reflection of each team member’s life and career experience in and around the IT field. </p>"+
"<p>Surprisingly, only Ben and Tatsuya’s ideal jobs specifically require a tertiary degree, with Nicole and John’s jobs favouring proficiency in industry standard skills, and Tarish’s preferring industry standard security certifications (which admittedly do require some tertiary level education) (Meah,J. 2022). </p>"+
"<p>With regards to the skills required for each job Ben and Nicole’s related roles require similar language, tool and soft skills. Tatsuya’s requires similar soft skills but a more tailored tool and language set to that of a software dev role. Both John and Tarish have chosen roles that prioritise proficiency in soft skills (teamwork, leadership, experience) with assumed technical tool and language proficiency.   </p>"+
"<p>John is the Kangaroos member closest to being application ready for his ideal role. The other 4 members are in the earlier stages of their IT careers and understandably lack the necessary skills required for their ideal jobs.

"<h4>App Development Story (so far)</h4>"+
"<p>Design for the app began during assignment 2. This included building a basic understanding of platforms, what would be included and what would be required to create an app to meet the goal. It was decided that the app would be a native app for iOS and Android. For the iOS app, Swift would be the programming language and XCode would be the IDE. For the Android app, Java would be the programming language and Android Studio would be the IDE. The design of the app is designed to be user-centred and uses Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics as a guideline for the user interface. Nielsen's usability heuristics focus on simplicity and usability, which are key factors in designing a basic app (Nielsen 1994). The purpose of the app is to connect to the Courtesy Light and allow the user to make two individualised messages that will be displayed on the hardware device.   </p>" +
"<h5>App Keypath Scenarios  </h5>" +
"<p>For the beginning of the design process, I created several keypath scenarios. Keypath scenarios are a design tool where you use a scenario to build a navigable path in the design (Lowdermilk, 2013). They are useful to app design because they help ensure that an app is designed with the user in mind. To create the keypath scenario, I started by identifying the primary tasks that users will perform in the app. Next, I mapped out the steps that a user would take to complete each task.   </p>" +
"<p>Once I created the keypath scenarios, I used them as a guide for the design and development of the app. They were beneficial in informing decisions about which features to include, how to present information, and how to make navigation intuitive. </p>" +
"<h5>Low-Fidelity Wireframes </h5>" +
"<p>Following the creation of keypath scenarios, I created a series of low-fidelity wireframes to ensure that I could fit this into the app's design. Low-fidelity wireframes are less detailed than the final design and don't focus on visual elements (Laubheimer, 2016). This allows for focusing on the layout, navigation, and functionality of the app. This means that you are able to easily make changes before it's too late in the process. Low-fidelity wireframes are beneficial for app design because they provide a fast way to explore design concepts early in the design process. </p>" +
"<p>Following the development of the low-fidelity wireframes, they were tested against the keypath scenarios. The keypath scenarios suggested a few minor modifications that needed to be made. Making these modifications was a simple process, thanks to the simplicity of low-fidelity wireframes. Once these modifications were made, I began work on the app prototype.  </p>" +
"<h5>App Prototype</h5>" +
"<p>The app prototype features the navigation and functionality of the app.</p>" +
"<p><b>Scenario 1:</b> Connecting to the device for the first time </p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>Ali opens the app and taps on the 'Settings' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali chooses the “Bluetooth” option from the menu.  </li>" +
"<li>The app searches for available Bluetooth devices and displays a list of them.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali selects the device he wants to connect to from the list.  </li>" +
"<li>The app sends a request to the device to establish a connection.  </li>" +
"<li>The device accepts the connection request, and the app displays a message indicating a successful connection.  </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<p><b>Scenario 2:</b> Connecting to the device that has been previously paired and writing a new custom message for the Courtesy Light</p>" +
"<ol>"+
"<li>Ali opens the app and taps on the 'Settings' button.  </li>" +
"<li>The app automatically connects to the device that has been previously paired as it is saved in the app's memory.  </li>" +
"<li>The app displays a message indicating a successful connection.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali returns to the app’s home screen through the navigation bar.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali taps the 'Customise' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali taps on the 'Change Message' button.  </li>" +
"<li>Ali types a message into the app and presses save.  </li>" +
"<li>The app sends a request to the device to change the message it's displaying.  </li>" +
"<li>The device receives the request, updates the message, and sends a confirmation to the app.  </li>" +
"<li>The app displays a message indicating a successful message change.  </li>" +
"</ol>"+
"<h5>Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics </h5>" +
"<p>For assignment 2, it was mentioned that the app’s user interface design would follow Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics. Below is an outline of how each of these heuristics is important in app design and how they each were integrated into the UI design prototype.  </p>" +
"<h6>1. Visibility of system status  </h6>" +
"<p>Visibility of system status is important in app design because when users perform an action within an app, they expect to receive immediate feedback about the status of their request. If the system status is not visible, users may become confused, frustrated or assume that their action was not processed. </p>" +
"<h6>2. Match between system and the real world  </h6>" +
"<p>Matching the system and the real world is important in app design because it helps create a smooth user experience. Users are better able to comprehend and navigate an app when its behaviour and interface reflect how people think and interact with the world.  </p>" +
"<h6>3. User control and freedom  </h6>" +
"<p>User control and freedom are important in app design as they give users the power to determine how they interact with the app. Accessibility can also be improved by allowing users to adjust the app to better meet their individual needs through user control and freedom. </p>" +
"<h6>4. Consistency and standards  </h6>" +
"<p>Consistency and standards are important in app design because they provide users with a clear and predictable experience. When an app follows established design patterns, users can understand how the app works and can easily navigate through it.  </p>" +
"<h6>5. Error prevention  </h6>" +
"<p>Error prevention is important in app design because it helps to minimise the risk of users making mistakes while using the app. This was accomplished by providing confirmations prior to carrying out potentially unintended actions, and by using the help and information page.  </p>" +
"<h6>6. Recognition rather than recall  </h6>" +
"<p>By prioritising recognition in app design, designers can create apps that are easy to navigate. This will reduce the cognitive load on the users. When users can recognise elements within an app, such as icons, buttons, and navigation, they are able to quickly and efficiently complete tasks without having to rely on their memory of where specific information is located. Recall, however, requires users to remember specific information, which can be frustrating and time-consuming.  </p>" +
"<h6>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use  </h6>" +
"<p>Flexibility and efficiency of use are important in app design because they allow users to easily accomplish their goals. The app has been designed to be efficient and save users time and effort by using an intuitive interface. Users will be more likely to continue using an app if they can complete tasks quickly and easily. </p>" +
"<h6>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design  </h6>" +
"<p>Aesthetic and minimalist design is important in app design because it can improve the user experience by making the app visually appealing and easy to navigate. Aesthetic design creates a positive first impression. Minimalist design, on the other hand, focuses on simplicity. This means reducing clutter and making it easier for users to focus on the most important elements of the app. The app has been designed to meet these heuristics through the visual design.   </p>" +
"<h6>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors  </h6>" +
"<p>Helping users to recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors is important in app design because by providing clear error messages, users can quickly identify a problem and take steps to resolve them. This will reduce frustration for the user, making them enjoy using the app. When users can quickly identify the source of an error, they can take appropriate action to resolve the issue. In addition, providing users with self-help options, such as a FAQ, can help to solve issues without having to seek assistance from others. The Courtesy Light app provides a full FAQ and information on the device specifications.   </p>" +
"<h6>10. Help and documentation  </h6>" +
"<p>Help and documentation are important in app design because they provide users with the information and support they need to effectively use the app. Clear and concise documentation can help users understand  how to complete specific tasks. Having access to a help section will also reduce the likelihood of errors.   </p>" +
"<h3>Roles</h3>" + 
"<p> Text </p>" +
"<h3>Scope and Limits </h3>" + 
"<p> Text </p>" +
"<h4>App Scope</h4>" +
"<p>The app design has four main goals. These goals are considered the scope of the app.  </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>Pairing and Connecting: The app should provide a simple way for the user to connect to the Courtesy Light device and establish a Bluetooth connection. </li>" +
"<li>Message customisation: The app should allow the user to create and edit custom messages to be displayed on the Courtesy Light. </li>" +
"<li>Secure Connection: The app should ensure secure communication between the user's device and the Courtesy Light to protect user data. </li>" +
"<li>User-friendly interface: The app should have a user-friendly interface, to make it easy for users to use all of its features.  </li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>" + 
"<h4>App Tools and Technologies  </h4>" +
"<p>The developers will be using the latest stable release for the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Using the latest stable release is beneficial because it contains the latest improvements (Humble & Farley, 2010). This may include new features and functionality that will make the development process easier. Using the most recent stable release is also likely to have improved compatibility with the most recent libraries, technologies, and tools. This is particularity crucial for the Courtesy Light's Bluetooth API compatibility.   </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>The latest stable release of XCode is version 14.2  </li>" +
"<li>The latest stable release of Android Studio is Android Studio Electric Eel | 2022.2.  </li>" +
"<li>The latest stable release of Swift is version 5.7.3  </li>" +
"<li>The latest stable release of Java is Java 19  </li>" +
"<li>The latest stable release of Firebase Realtime Database SDK is 10.5.0 for iOS and 31.2.0 for Android (Java version).   </li>" +
"</ul>" +
"<p>The low-fidelity wireframes and app prototype use the web application Figma.  </p>" +
"<ul>" + 
"<li>Figma developed by Figma, Inc. Note: Figma has a free and premium version. I have used the premium version for the prototype, because I have a license from another course I am doing.   </li>" +

"<h3>Testing</h3>" +
"<p>After we develop the idea ourselves, with all of the features and design capabilities to handle the use-cases we see fit, we will conduct a survey (created via free online tool Survey Monkey) in order to gather feedback from the general public. The questions in this survey will cover people’s past experience with road rage, the likelihood of consumers taking up a product like the Courtesy Light, what types of transport they use, and what potential extra features they would like to see from a product like the Courtesy Light that could potentially be implemented into future revisions. This survey can be accessed via the following link <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3KVYVQS'> https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3KVYVQS</a>. </p>" +
"<p>Market testing or beta testing is a critical stage in bringing a product to market. It involves testing the product with a smaller group of potential customers or early adopters to gather feedback and make any necessary improvements before the releasing the product to the full market (Teel 2016). Bringing a new product to the market is costly so it is paramount that concept development & testing along with market testing is done to extract as much feedback and data for the focused market. The demographic to target for the courtesy light is car owners who want to convey appreciation and gratitude to other drivers on the road. Additionally, the product can appeal to individuals who want a simple and user-friendly way to improve road safety by drawing attention to reckless driving behaviours. The strategy that projects team has decided on here is to conduct a survey targeted towards ride sharing drivers and delivery partners, such as Uber and Lyft, that can help to gather important feedback on the idea and gauge interest in participating in the concept testing. A full working week for an average uber driver is around 37.4 hours according to Alexander et al. (2022).  </p>" +
"<p>We believe that because they spend a significant amount of time on the road and are more likely to have noticed a gap in the market for this product, this demographic will be ideal for contributing to our testing phase. The results of the survey, feedback from the concept testing phase, and any additional data and insights gathered through market research will be included in our acceptance criteria for this project. Our acceptance criteria for this project will be based on three key factors: Functionality, Performance, and Usability/Compatibility. Our goal is to ensure that the product meets the needs and expectations of our target market and performs well in real-world scenarios. The data and feedback collected through our survey and concept testing phase will be used to evaluate the product's functionality and performance, while user experience and compatibility with different car models and road conditions will also be taken into consideration. Ultimately, we aim to develop a product that not only meets but exceeds the expectations of our target market and contributes to road safety. Survey Monkey, a popular survey tool, will be used to collect data and insights from our target demographic. </p>" +
"<p>This information will help us determine the product's potential success and guide the next steps in its development and commercialisation. In addition, we will assess the product's ability to meet customer expectations and provide a positive user experience. This will be done during the concept testing phase, in which we will create 6-8 concept designs and distribute them to Uber drivers who expressed interest in participating via the survey. We will collect feedback from participants on their experience with the concepts, including usability, design, and overall satisfaction, using survey monkey once more. This data will be used to improve the design during subsequent product development and, ultimately, to bring the product to market with confidence that it will meet the needs and expectations of its target audience. The ultimate goal of this project is to bring to market a product that solves a problem and adds value to its target audience. We will consider the project successful if it meets the requirements and standards outlined in the project plan and passes all tests with few or no errors. Additionally, user feedback and acceptance of the final product will be used to determine project success. </p>" +
"<h4>App Development Testing </h4>" +
"<p>App testing is an essential part of software development and a crucial step in ensuring the quality and usability of an application. App testing is an iterative process (Unadkat, 2022), and it is important to repeat the testing process multiple times to ensure that the app is of high quality and meets the needs of the users. There are several stages of app testing, including unit testing, functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and user testing (Android, 2022). These types of testing all require a different approach in order to test the app’s functionality.  </p>" +
"<p>Unit testing involves testing individual components of an app to ensure they function as expected in isolation. This type of testing helps identify and fix any bugs or errors in the early stages of development (Muccini et al., 2012). This will make it easier to catch and fix problems before they have the chance to get worse. Functional testing is the process of verifying that an app meets its specified requirements and functions as intended. During functional testing, the app is tested in different scenarios, such as different input combinations, different screen sizes, and different operating systems. This is done to make sure it works as expected under different conditions. Performance testing is the process of evaluating an app’s performance and behaviour under real-world conditions. This type of testing is designed to identify performance bottlenecks and other issues that may impact the user experience. This includes things such as slow load times, long wait times, or poor app responsiveness. Security testing is performed to evaluate the app's security features and to identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers or attackers. User testing is the final step in the testing process, where the app is tested by users to ensure that it meets their requirements and expectations. This is done as part of a beta or market research test. We have outlined our plans to conduct this type of testing elsewhere in this section.  </p>" +
"<p>Concerning the testing that has been done so far for the Courtesy Light app, all testing has been within the unit testing and functional testing stages. This is because the prototype created for this assignment is UI design based, rather than programming based. Further development on the app would require completing other stages of testing to take place to ensure a fully functional and efficient app. Testing has included creation of keypath scenarios and low-fidelity wireframes. These were created to ensure that the user goals can be accomplished through the app. Low-Fidelity wireframes are beneficial to the testing process because they are a cheap and easy way to test functionality. By creating a simple and rough outline of the app's structure, it was easy to identify and address any potential issues with the layout, navigation, and overall user experience. This allowed for faster prototyping, resulting in a smoother design process. The testing for the app also involved creating several keypath scenarios. These scenarios were concerned with achieving the user’s goals for using the app. When tested, the keypath scenarios worked effectively with the wireframes. This suggests that the design has so far proven functional.   </p>" +
"<h3>Timeframe</h3>" + 
"<p> Text </p>" +
"<h3>Risks</h3>" + 
"<p> Text </p>" +
"<h4>App Risks</h4>" +
"<p>Using Bluetooth to connect the app to the Courtesy Light device has potential to be a security risk if proper measures aren’t taken. Bluetooth technology is not fully secure and can be vulnerable to hacking, making it easier for attackers to access sensitive information transmitted through the app (Loveless, 2018). Connecting to a device through an app that uses Bluetooth can potentially compromise the security of both the device and the user's personal information stored on it. Bluetooth signals can also be disrupted by other electronic devices, resulting in a loss of connection or data transmission errors.  </p>" +
"<p>Encryption and disabling Bluetooth when not in use are common preventative measures. The Firebase Realtime Database has a set of developer tools to assist with security measures. These include; Security rules, user authentication, encryption, and access tokens. Successful integration of these security measures will decrease the risk from third party attacks through the Bluetooth connection.  </p>" +
"<h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3>" + 
"<p>Clear and effective communication is paramount to the success of any project, and group projects are no exception. A well-organized and planned communication plan ensures that all team members are on the same page and working towards the same goal. We will employ a variety of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools, such as face-to-face meetings, video conferencing via Microsoft teams, email, and instant messaging, as a group. Meetings will take place once a week, with additional meetings planned as needed. Meeting agendas and minutes will be distributed ahead of time to ensure that everyone is aware of the topics to be discussed as well as the tasks given to each team member. </p>" +
"<p>We will have a strategy in place to ensure that we can still make progress towards our goals if a team member does not reply to contact attempts. We will also establish a protocol for dealing with critical problems and how promptly responses are expected. We can ensure that the group remains focused, motivated, and productive throughout the project by establishing clear communication norms and expectations </p>" +

"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>As a group of people with varying backgrounds who had never met before, we came together and collaborated very well to complete the assignment within the scheduled deadlines. Our organisation and time management were our strengths.</p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>Decision making on what the project would be could have been improved and decisions made earlier in the process. However, the feasibility of the project was an early concern to the group and made deciding on the project more complex. The group used a voting system to get the consensus based on 3 concept ideas. It was decided through that medium that simplicity would be advantageous to us in the later stages should the concept idea need building.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>That the team didn’t require direct leadership. We all contributed effectively and were proactive on taking action to complete tasks that need doing rather than having someone assign tasks to them. This team was built on initiative and collective benefit which is unusual within a new group of people.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>People often play down or are not confident about their skills or what they can offer in group situations.</p>"+
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>The team used MS Teams as their primary communication platform. Weekly meetings were set up  along with meeting agenda and minutes, however MS teams chats was used as required during the week for general conversations and updates. Git updates messages were reflective of the updates by the team and were easy to understand and track. However, due to the configuration of the webpage, most updates were text based for the assignment sections rather than coding level updates. Access to Git and GitHub and teams was provided to all members while recordings etc were located on SharePoint, MS Teams repository. Alignment of GitHub updates and tasks allocated to team members during meetings mirrored very closely</p>" +

"<h2>Nicole Brooker</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>For this assignment, our group planned well ahead of when the assignment was due. This gave us plenty of time later on to organise and coordinate when we were working on more complicated parts of this assignment. The group has been able to effectively communicate through Microsoft Teams and everyone has been active and participated. </p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>While the group planned ahead, we took a decent amount of time to decide on a team project idea. This was largely due to discussion around what assignment 3 would require of our group and how everyone's interests and skill sets could be best utilised.   </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>Our group was able to work well despite obstacles faced. For example, we had a member leave within the first couple of weeks and the work that had been allocated to them was swiftly undertaken by another group member. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>One thing that I have learned about groups is the benefit of group work when people are engaged. Group members brought different perspectives through their work, which I think was a great benefit to our final assignment.   </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>Our group’s GitHub log is not necessarily a reflection on how our group worked for this assignment. This is due to our group making commits for small and large sections of this assignment and general troubleshooting taking up a generous number of commits.    </p>" +

"<h2>Benjamin Turner</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the kangaroos team early on decided to divide up the tasks between members based on our skillsets and interest areas. This proved to be a good decision as it minimised friction between team members in terms of our contributions and ensured we all had a set of tasks to perform.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>I think initially we were a bit reserved in terms of communication in Microsoft Teams and the meetings, but this got better once we began to get to know each other. We were also a bit hesitant in making group decisions regarding the project topic.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>I was honestly surprised at how open everyone was to help if other team members were having issues. I have worked in teams before where there was an expectation that we all made our contributions, but it was the burden of one or two to pick up the slack (nominated as editors or scribes for example), but here things have been very smooth with everyone working to their strengths.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learnt the value of open discussion regarding updating team other team members on progress of our sections. It ensures all team members are on the same page or can make adjustments to the workload if need be. </p>" +

"<p>I feel the GitHub activity log does not necessarily accurate trace of amount of work done by team members overall but it does show that we were all participating. Whether individuals decided to add their contributions in large batches, in a series of small commits, or had others upload their sections, the logs can make it seem like some team members did significantly more work than the others which is not the case.</p>" +
"<p>That said the group meeting discussion and meeting minutes documents are a closer reflection to how the work was divided amongst team members. We were quite active in the message forums within Microsoft Teams as well as regularly uploading our work into a shared template document and later a shared document for submission.</p>" +

"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>To accomplish the project, we successfully created clear goals and objectives for the assignment and collaborated well. The group members communicated effectively, allowing us to all comprehend the responsibilities allocated to us. Our major communication platform was Microsoft Teams, and we held weekly meetings with agendas and minutes. We also used Microsoft Teams to deliver updates regularly. Similarly, to assignment 2, the team shared their work via a shared template document and, ultimately, a shared document for submission. Because of our effective communication and collaboration, we were able to complete the assignment quickly and obtain the required results.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team performed exceptionally well and there were no major issues to be addressed. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>One of the surprising parts of this project was the team's level of structure. We worked together to complete a task list set out by one of the group members, this ensured that each member understood their roles and what needed to be accomplished.  </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +

"<p> I believe that our team “Kangaroos” is well organized and structured to accomplish our end goal as a team. The team has organized meetings, scheduled every week to allow us to assign and discuss certain topics about our assignment.  We have assigned roles that best suit to everyone’s strengths and weaknesses to efficiently contribute to our assignment.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team as a whole is dedicated and well organised with little room for improvement however, an area that I could have improved on would be my website development skills so I could have contributed more towards the development of the website. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>One thing that surprised me was the diversity of our group members and how we were able to work coherently as a team to accomplish our end goal. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +

"<h2>Group Reflection </h2>"+
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>The team was able to allocate tasks for the assignment outputs based on early decisions to read each other's profiles created as part of assignment 1. This allowed us to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses and form an understanding of how to approach the assignment tasks as a team .The teams early agreement to use MS Teams as a standard communication medium, combined with regular meetings that were scheduled, the team was able to rely on each and every team member to support each other for general issues, understanding during the week. Due to the planning element of the teams, using meeting agendas, minutes and scheduled meetings, it allowed the team to produce a quality report and web page which employed all the teams input and skills.  </p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team worked exceptionally well together based on the limited time we had to come together as a group. The key improvement area we identified was decision making, with particular reference to the project idea. The team deferred the idea to later in the production of the assignment outputs, while this allowed the team to move forward on production of the document and webpages, it was also something that was of concern. The team rectified this by using a voting system, however it wasn't so much that the team members disagreed with ideas but more that the next assignment is linked to this idea and this caused us to re-think because of the lack of clarity. Despite this the team moved forward and chose an idea and shows how well the team have come together.  </p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>The surprising element to the team revolved around the diversity and efficiency of the group to work together as a group. The team members quickly came to the understanding that each one of us was able to offer skills and support to each other despite differing levels of skill against a specific area. Everyone had something that another team member needed and each member was willing and able to help.   </p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>The team learned more than anything both as a group and individually that groups require cooperation and understanding that each member is important. To be successful all team member need to be engaged and pro-active. This means to support each team member when needed and to contribute in multiple ways, advice, technical, emotionally or just being there to ask a question in some way. Much of our interactions were via messages so it really doesn't matter how the interactions in the group happen but that they do.  </p>"+
